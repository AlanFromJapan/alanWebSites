<img src="/files/20240118_220624.jpg" align="right" width="200"/>Bought a bunch of GameBoy/NDS last year 2023, and started fixing a few for the practice and for the fun. One must have been stored in the dirt or something approaching, how full of dirt (no better word) there was even inside.<br/>
I managed to make it partially work again, here's what I did (Jan2024).

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Initial status</h2>
* VERY dirty, like old sawdust inside and dirty as hell outside
* Battery dead (measures 0 volt)
* GBA port dead (partially covered in that beautiful blue copper oxide)
* NDS port ok!
* Screen has some dead LIGHT rows (a few on each screen) but image pixels are ok, so usable. Touch is ok.
* Power port oxydized
<h2>Action plan</h2>
Battery is dead, not planning to spend on a new one. But problem is that NDS will NOT boot on wallwart power if it doesn't detect a battery (and a healthy one please, less than 3.6v undercharge protection will kick in). Considering the power port was goneski, and that seeing its overall shape it will be "for practice" only, I decided to make it a wallwart only model by simulating a battery (5v to 3.7v buck).<br/>

* Bye battery
* Desoldered the old dead power connector, and then 2 ferrites (wasted space)
* Desoldered the battery connector
* Stuck a DC-DC buck converter (a cheapo [[MH-MINI-360]]) with tape
* Stuck a USB-C female connector module where the power was with LOTS of (way too much) epoxy
* Dremeled a hole where the battery was in the back cover to allow for the buck converter and cables
* Dremeled out all the excess epoxy and USB-C module board so I could put back the back cover.

With the buck converter.<br/>

Had to dremel the sh*t of the USB-C board to let the lid close, but in the end it did.<br/>

WIth the back cover installed (the battery covers all that)<br/>

It works!
