**Rapide555** is a board of my //RapideXXX// series, small boards for quick prototyping, with everything you need around one component. This time, the all famous [[timers and 555|555]]!

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
Small board, monopurposed or multipurposed if better. For me 555 rhymes with PWM, so that will be the base business case (<- I'm working too much). Then around that I want to be able to hijack that quickly into other fun use cases of the mythic 555: monostable, on-off button etc... I won't fit them all, there's entire books about 555 circuits! Just make sure I have enough pins free for soldering the puppy in other config than PWM.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* 555 in DIP format (I like it retro, and 8 pins anyway you're not saving much with the SMD version)
* PPTC?
* Power regulation?
* 2 free PCB holes per pin, in case
* Solder switch ready to close to immediately get a PWM config
* Optional status LED
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<h3>PWM555 (as in [[Aquarium Lights]])</h3>

Gives a nice 98% - 8% or less range. Could be made better though.
* IC1: 555 in DIP format
* R1 and R2: 100 ohm
* R3: 470 ohm
* D1: Schottky diode
* C1: 0.1 uF
* Q1: IRFZ44N MOSFET
* R6: potentiometer, 1k - 10k
