<img src="/files/ublok6gps1.JPG" align="right" width="250" />I just bought on [[http://www.ebay.com/itm/GY-NEO6MV2-NEO-6M-GPS-Module-Board-with-Antenna-for-Arduino-Raspberry-Pi/142233250679|eBay]] a **GY-NEO6MV2 NEO-6M** board for less than 5 USD. Looks neat, came with a small antenna, and get easily a fix from nearby satellites ... sweet!<br/>
Originally I plan to use it as a GPS based clock, but maybe it will become more? Who knows. Anyway, this is a technical page for future reference.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Cheap!
* GPS!
* working fine
<h1>Points of concern</h1>
<h2>Antenna</h2>
Antenna ain't not the strongest, need to be close to a window to get the signal. Could be improved?

<h2>Time message (NMEA ZDA)</h2>
By default the standard time message NMEA ZDA is no issued (at least on my model), but there's different workarounds.<br/>
<h3>Use UBLOX custom message</h3>
Seems the <code>UBX 04</code> message is a good alternate and will send me the time! To be tested. Just send <code>$PUBX,04*37<CR><LF></code> and we're good to go.<br/>
EDit: and it works ! I got the below line:
<pre>
$PUBX,04,113011.00,041017,300611.00,1969,15D,-45227909,0.000,21*73
</pre>
Meaning it is now UTC 11:30:11.00 (+9h for Tokyo), on the 4th October 2017. Perfect.<br/>

<h3>Enable the ZDA</h3>
Seems you need to send some CFG-MSG to force the frequency of the ZDA message... will call this option B.
