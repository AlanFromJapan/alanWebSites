Every where I read, people say that working with the 10 $ iron is bad and should be avoided as soon as you start doing &quot;serious things&quot;. Next step is to move to a branded iron, with a variator to control the temperature and maybe a precise selection of temperature (display or gradation). Well shame is I happen to like my 10 $ 40W iron, even if I agree it's too hot, but has the punch when needed for a quick start or some heavy job. <br />
A few months ago I bought a simple 6$ variator kit and setup my iron on it, worked just fine. But I wanted to have more safety, especially not risk to forget my iron on. So I though of combining both: a <strong>variator</strong>, a <strong>light</strong> indication of the ON status, and a <strong>timer</strong> ! 10 minutes max : press the white button and get 3 minutes of heating, press the red button and stop now. <br />
<br />
I found afterward a video of the crazy-fantastic Dave of EEVBlog that was also having the same concern of &quot;is my iron still on&quot; and hacked his Hakko led <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtlN0b-gkic" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtlN0b-gkic</a><br />
