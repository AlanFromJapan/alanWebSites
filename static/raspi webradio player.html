A Raspberry pi zero W used as a WebRadio player! Because I can't work without music and turning on the PC to open Youtube is taking too much of my productivity away. So webradio looks like the way to go!

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
Seems you just need to MPD/MPC to play the web streams, a way to output the sound (I have somewhere an eBay soundcard or default sound output?), a display of what is the current track, and some way to control it (change station at least).
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* Raspberry pi zero W
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<h3>Make sound from a raspi zero without soundcard</h3>
Explained [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tinkernut-diy-pi-zero-audio/|here]] and [[https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-raspberry-pi-zero/audio-outputs|here]], you need to redirect 2 pins on their alternate pin, and make a small low/high pass filter with resistors and caps.
<h2>Source code</h2>
<pre><code class="bash">
#install MPC/MPD to play the audio streams
sudo apt-get install mpc mpd

#install VLC and pulseaudio
sudo apt-get install vlc pulseaudio

</code></pre>
edit the etc mpd.conf change the folder for music and add correct HW -> hw:1,0
list hw avec aplay -l
put files in fodler
mpc add / (add all)
mpc play
mpc volume 100

<h2>Power consideration</h2>
I'd like to put the raspi zero W in sleep mode when unused to minimize power consumption AND maximize the benefit on start time. There's no real power management on the Raspi HW, so basically you have to cut the power on everything that is unused to save a few watts.<br/>
Here's a few links I found:
* Stop HDMI <code>/usr/bin/tvservice -o</code> (-p to re-enable) from [[https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy|here]]
