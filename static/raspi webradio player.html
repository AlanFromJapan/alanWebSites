A Raspberry pi zero W used as a WebRadio player! Because I can't work without music and turning on the PC to open Youtube is taking too much of my productivity away. So webradio looks like the way to go!

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
Seems you just need to MPD/MPC to play the web streams, a way to output the sound (I have somewhere an eBay soundcard or default sound output?), a display of what is the current track, and some way to control it (change station at least).
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* Raspberry pi zero W
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<h3>Make sound from a raspi zero without soundcard</h3>
Explained [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tinkernut-diy-pi-zero-audio/|here]] and [[https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-raspberry-pi-zero/audio-outputs|here]], you need to redirect 2 pins on their alternate pin, and make a small low/high pass filter with resistors and caps.

<h2>User account "radio" preparation</h2>
Because you should never run any non-interactive program with sudoer-rights account (root, pi, ...) so make a separate account that has the minimum necessary rights.
<pre><code class="bash">
#make a user named "radio"
sudo adduser radio
#add user to the audio group if you want sound :)
sudo usermod -a -G audio radio
#add user to the netdev group if you want to access the internet
sudo usermod -a -G netdev radio
#add user to the gpio gorup to acces GPIO for the buttons
sudo usermod -a -G gpio radio
#add user to the i2c group to acces I2C bus for the screen
sudo usermod -a -G i2c radio
#allow user radio to shutdown the machine
# 1- sudo visudo
# 2- add line
radio ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff, /sbin/reboot, /sbin/shutdown

#add to your .bashrc the below 2 lines to start pulseaudio as a user daemon (apparently it shouldn't be a system daemon)
#START PULSEAUDIO as a per user daemon
pulseaudio -D
</code></pre>

<h2>Source code : with VLC</h2>
VLS is more power hungry but this Raspi will only play radio so... even if it uses 40% CPU, it won't make a difference.
<pre><code class="bash">
#install VLC and pulseaudio
sudo apt-get install vlc pulseaudio
</code></pre>

Now it should work, so listen to music with:
* Normal case: <code>vlc //your-URL-here// -I dummy </code>
* If you need details when things go south : <code>vlc //your-URL-here// -I dummy **--verbose=2**</code>

How to change the volume:
* SET volume to 85%: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master 85%</code>
* INCREASE volume by 7%: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master 7%+</code>


<h2>Source code : with MPC</h2>
<span style="color:red;">MPC/MPD does work, though I used VLC because it's simpler to configure. However as far as I tested the below setup works, you can take it from there and finish.</span>
<pre><code class="bash">
#install MPC/MPD to play the audio streams
sudo apt-get install mpc mpd

</code>
edit the etc mpd.conf change the folder for music and add correct HW -> hw:1,0
list hw avec aplay -l
put files in fodler
mpc add / (add all)
mpc play
mpc volume 100
</pre>

<h2>Display screen</h2>
Using a small [[https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf|2.13 inch I2C SSD1306]] (address 0x3c) with [[https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306|Adafruit library]] (for python3):
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-pip python3-pip
sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
#doesn't work - unmaintained since 2014
#sudo pip install Adafruit-SSD1306

sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
sudo python3 -m pip install pillow

#install necessary packages
sudo apt-get install python-smbus python3-smbus
#to check that you can see the 0x3c on the I2C bus #1
i2cdetect 1
</pre>
Now the Ladyada code should work, however change the samples //for my component//:
* address is 0x3c (not 0x3d)
* the height is 32 not 64 pixels


<h2>Power consideration</h2>
I'd like to put the raspi zero W in sleep mode when unused to minimize power consumption AND maximize the benefit on start time. There's no real power management on the Raspi HW, so basically you have to cut the power on everything that is unused to save a few watts.<br/>
Here's a few links I found:
* Stop HDMI <code>/usr/bin/tvservice -o</code> (-p to re-enable) from [[https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy|here]]

<h2>Radios!</h2>
Go to the radio site or [[https://tunein.com|TuneIn]], F12, Network tab and look for a .mp3 or .m3u file. No magical solution apparently.
