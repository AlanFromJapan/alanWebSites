I looooove woodworking, my heart always balances between that and electronics. I work on it to get better, so I get to guy tools. But I'm cheap, and I decided to buy a cheap drill powered battery (a Bosch if you care) with old dead 14.4v Ni-Mh batteries. I got changed the battery of my office laptop the other day and got to keep the old ones; they would still last 1h30 but after that they'd let me down. But it's enough for drilling a few holes!<br/>
So let me explain how I did it...<br/>

<h1>Principle</h1>
<div style="border: solid 2px red;text-align:center;"><b>DISCLAIMER</b> (especially for the trolls)<br/>
I <b>know</b> this is not the optimum way to make a multiple cell Li-Ion charger. I can already see the foam on the lips of internet trolls.<br/>
I like the idea of reusing different components, combining them together and making them work as one. Like this charger. I know that if I spent a few hours on mouser I'd find a component that do just what I want for a few bucks, or maybe a all made module on eBay for 10 bucks... I like the challenge, I like the "rusticity" of the build, it's gonna be unique, clickety, with bling bling, clumsy, and maybe a fire hazard. So just don't make the same as me, but you're free to watch.</div>

* Micro controller: TBD
* Relay (x8): hk4100f-dc5v-shg (cheap 5v relays on eBay)
* Transistor array to drive the relays: [[http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gI-02771/|Toshiba TD62064APG]]
* LiPo charger: whichever found on eBay for 2 bucks. Mine is based on Top Power TP4056, a 1A max charger.
* Connector: I used a 5 pins connector found on eBay
