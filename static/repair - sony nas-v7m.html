Again, in Japan things are sorted, it's a separate box : I don't go diving in a see of garbage and used diapers to fetch these things. Anyway, since my wife needed something like that I brought it home. Let's try to fix it !<br />

Item is clean, no apparent degradation, no bruises, no scratch (again, I love Japan). A fair bit of dust though, indicates it had most likely not been used for some times.<br />
<strong>Feeding it the AC power : </strong> standby led turns red, the right hand display has the retro-lightning turning on (or so), and you can hear the device emit a hit pitched faint hiss (regulator screaming for help?)<br />
Hitting the On/Off switch does nothing, like all the other buttons. <br />
<br />
<em>First hypothesis :</em> maybe power issue on the secondary or a dead cap (please make it a dead cap, my ESR meter arrived today in the mail, and it's easy to fix). Only solution, the operating room !<br />
<br />
<em>UPDATE: (later that night)</em> after opening the baby, which was not that easy I can finally access the insides. And after searching on the net, apparently Sony did a little mistake with those speakers : there's a problem with the power IC and seems that after some times the machine just refuses to turn on. Hum ... seems pretty close of my problem. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.sony.jp/system-stereo/info/20120308.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.sony.jp/system-stereo/info/20120308.html</a><br />

My ultimate goal: fix it without getting shocked by AC or breaking it over the repairability point.<br />
