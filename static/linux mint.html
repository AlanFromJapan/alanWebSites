My old tiny laptop stated to have a hard time under windows 7, and its small disk forced me to reinstall. So reinstalling for reinstalling, let's go Linux! Under the advice of a friend of mine (thanks Ivan), I installed a Linux mint 17.3 "Rosa".<br/>
It's a good distribution, and over the last 20 years Linux made so much progress from those debians or redhats I installed when I was 15 (ah youth). Come to think of it that was also under the suggestion of my Linux senpai "Christophe".<br/>
Enough rambling, down to business...<br/> 

<h2>Burn the iso on a USB</h2>
<ol>
* find the /dev/sdX of your USB key (mount -l)
* run the magic command : <code>sudo dd bs=20M if=the-linux-iso.iso of=/dev/sdX</code> (no partition number!) (the bs block size parameter can be set to the least common M/s speed both input/output disk support
* make sure to properly unmount the drive, to avoid missing pending writings
* Then enable [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md|SSH and Wifi for headless]]
* ssh default credentials are pi/raspberry
</ol>

<h2>Install</h2>
Use **synaptic** to do the installs unless otherwise specified:
<ul>
* arduino
* eclipse (article about [[http://interactive-matter.eu/how-to/developing-software-for-the-atmel-avr-with-avr-eclipse-avr-gcc-avrdude/|avr dev under eclipse]] and another about  [[http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Eclipse|Arduino and eclipse]] cohabitation)
* avr-gcc and most of the avr* packages, avrdude, etc...
* binutils and binutils-avr (should be installed as dependency anyway)
* emacs
* htop
* iBus for [[http://www.localizingjapan.com/blog/2014/07/29/japanese-input-on-linux-mint-17-qiana-cinnamon/|Japanese input]]
* keepassX
* git
* owncloud client
</ul>

One shot apt-get:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install emacs-nox htop git  
</pre>

<h2>Additional setup</h2>
<h3>Using USB ports</h3>
You need to be sudoer to use the usb ports :( Found the explanation [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5412727/avrisp-mkii-doesnt-work-with-avrdude-on-linux|here]]. Problem is **udev** that is acting a bit.
* You need your user to be in the group //dialout//
* You need to add a rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder. Basically copy the following code in a file like 10-local.rules to override rules by default. You can find the details of your USB programmer with //lsusb -v// (mine is a avrisp mkII and has Product ID 2104)
<pre>
SUBSYSTEM!="usb", ACTION!="add", GOTO="avrisp_end"

# Atmel Corp. JTAG ICE mkII
ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="2103", MODE="660", GROUP="dialout"
# Atmel Corp. AVRISP mkII
ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="2104", MODE="660", GROUP="dialout"
# Atmel Corp. Dragon
ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="2107", MODE="660", GROUP="dialout"

LABEL="avrisp_end"
</pre>
* a small restart of udevd might be needed, but the README file in the config folder says not needed... anyway, unplug and replug your programmer, you don't need to sudo anymore

<h2>Burnin CD/DVD on USB</h2>
Found that on the net, used on the Xbmcbuntu pc, should work the same:
<pre>sudo growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr0=whatever-iso-you-want-to-burn.iso</pre>
/dev/sr0 is my DVDRom, might be different. Use dmesg to see where it's mounted for you.

<h2>OwnCloud client</h2>
Things got easier with time, no just read this page: [[https://owncloud.org/download/]]

<h2>Canon printers</h2>
If you are like me living in Japan and using second hand laser printers from Canon (MF4200 for instance) you'll be happy to know that Canon has a set of drivers for your printer. Go to the following link, download, run and RTFM. Thank you Canon!<br/>
[[https://cweb.canon.jp/drv-upd/lasershot/linux/lipslxlinux.html]]

<h2>Netflix</h2>
Just install google Chrome and you're done. Go to [[https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/]] and you're done...

<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
My usual shortcuts to add to //.profile// for instance...
<pre>
alias als="ls -alF"
alias gitpush="git push origin master --tags"
alias gitadd="git add -A"
alias gitcommit="git commit"
alias gitALL="gitadd;gitcommit;gitpush"
alias gitupd="git pull origin master"
</pre>

<h2>Disable root login via SSH</h2>
First, disable root login. Just make sure you have another sudoer user somewhere, or you'll just lock yourself out of the admin mode. 
<pre>
passwd -l root
</pre>
Then, to be clean, disable root login in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
<pre>
PermitRootLogin no
</pre> 

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
//It doesn't work and I fixed or worked around it. So if it helps you...//
<h2>⇒　My Linux Mint keeps on loosing internet (Mint 18.1 Serena)</h2>
**Situation: **in fact Wifi does work, try putting an IP and you're good. Restarting your wireless connection fix the problem. So it drills down to "DNS resolution failing after a few minutes". <br/>
**Guilty: **dnsmasq. <br/>
**Solution:** deactivate that "addition" by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and #comment out the line dns=dnsmasq, and reboot (you can restart the NW manager only but ...)
<br/>
<h2>⇒　My Linux Mint lost Windows 7 in double boot</h2>
**Situation: **you finally decided to give up on Windows 7/8/10 and install mint, double boot setup but no "Windows" option on the grub boot.<br/>
**Guilty: **grub <br/>
**Solution:** update grub: //sudo update-grub// and that should fix it. If not, enjoy updating grub manually...
