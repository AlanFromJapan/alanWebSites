So basically I'll just reuse his work, but make a PCB for that. I'll try to do minimum code changes, none if possible.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
With V-USB emulate an USB controller from the SNES Joypad. Raphael original work supports many different models of joypads (SNES, NES, ...) but I care only about SNES. I want also if possible to have this board reusable for other small USB projects so if possible it won't be an joypad emulator only. And I want to have a certain freedom to move pins around.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Making the solder pads for a SNES controller plug that you can find on eBay. I bought some years ago just for this. Should be relatively standard to work with any brand.
* If possible double trace for SMD or DIP components (ie: ATmegaxx8 SMD or DIP format)
* Micro or Mini USB or free cable
* Accessible ID pin for USB OTG
* Reusable for other projects with a little free soldering zone
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<h2>Source code</h2>
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/Atmegaxx8/nes_snes_db9_usb|Code]] : the initial commit is the source code as-is from Raphael
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/eagle/SNES2USB|PCB]] on GitHub.
PCB versions:
* v1.0 [Feb2020] that's what happens when you work at 1am: I sent for production without the V-USB logo as usual. Otherwise board "should be" ok.
<h1>How to use</h1>
If you want to use the vanilla code, solder close the following SMD solder-jumpers:
* J_D-D4 (bottom) : if not, you have to wire where the D- goes on the CPU 
* J_D+D2 (bottom) : if not, you have to wire where the D+ goes on the CPU 
* JPC (bottom) : if not, wire the SNES connector CLOCK pin yourself
* JPL (bottom) : if not, wire the SNES connector LATCH pin yourself
* JPD (bottom) : if not, wire the SNES connector DATA pin yourself
