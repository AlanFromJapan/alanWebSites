So basically I'll just reuse his work, but make a PCB for that. I'll try to do minimum code changes, none if possible.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
With V-USB emulate an USB controller from the SNES Joypad. Raphael original work supports many different models of joypads (SNES, NES, ...) but I care only about SNES. I want also if possible to have this board reusable for other small USB projects so if possible it won't be an joypad emulator only. And I want to have a certain freedom to move pins around.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Making the solder pads for a SNES controller plug that you can find on eBay. I bought some years ago just for this. Should be relatively standard to work with any brand.
* ATmegaxx8 SMD or DIP format
* Micro or Mini USB or free cable
* Accessible ID pin for USB OTG
* Reusable for other projects with a little free soldering zone

<h2>Source code</h2>
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/Atmegaxx8/nes_snes_db9_usb|Code]] : the initial commit is the source code as-is from Raphael
* PCB (TODO!)
