So basically I'll just reuse his work, but make a PCB for that. I'll try to do minimum code changes, none if possible.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
With V-USB emulate an USB controller from the SNES Joypad. Raphael original work supports many different models of joypads (SNES, NES, ...) but I care only about SNES. I want also if possible to have this board reusable for other small USB projects so if possible it won't be an joypad emulator only. And I want to have a certain freedom to move pins around.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Making the solder pads for a SNES controller plug that you can find on eBay. I bought some years ago just for this. Should be relatively standard to work with any brand.
* If possible double trace for SMD or DIP components (ie: ATmegaxx8 SMD or DIP format)
* Micro or Mini USB or free cable
* Accessible ID pin for USB OTG
* Reusable for other projects with a little free soldering zone

<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<h2>Source code</h2>
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/Atmegaxx8/nes_snes_db9_usb|Code]] : the initial commit is the source code as-is from Raphael
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/eagle/SNES2USB|PCB]] on GitHub.
<h2>PCB versions</h2>
<H3>v1.0 [Feb2020]</h3> 
That's what happens when you work at 1am: I sent for production without the V-USB logo as usual. Other problems:
* The holes for the SNES connector are too small. They are 1mm but the SNES pins are 1.5mm (lessons learned, I'll use my good caliper next time and not the cheap one). Just redrill them with a **1.5mm** and solder both sides.

<h1>How to use</h1>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
If you want to use the vanilla code, solder close the following SMD solder-jumpers:
* J_D-D4 (bottom) : if not, you have to wire where the D- goes on the CPU 
* J_D+D2 (bottom) : if not, you have to wire where the D+ goes on the CPU 
* JPC (bottom) : if not, wire the SNES connector CLOCK pin yourself
* JPL (bottom) : if not, wire the SNES connector LATCH pin yourself
* JPD (bottom) : if not, wire the SNES connector DATA pin yourself
<h2>Fuses</h2>
Then set the fuses (reminder it's an ATmega328p):
* High: 0xDB
* Low: 0xDF
* Extended: 0xFD
The command in case <code>avrdude -pm328p -cavrispmkII -u  -Ulfuse:w:0xdf:m -Uhfuse:w:0xdb:m -Uefuse:w:0xfd:m</code>
