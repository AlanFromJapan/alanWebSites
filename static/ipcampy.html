A lightweight web app in python meant to run on a raspi to show the feed from an IP Camera while forbidding the IP Camera itself to access/be accessed by internet.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
I have an IP Camera at home, but I don't trust the software on it: easily hackable (purposedly or not), malware on it, etc. Don't want to take risks, plus I'm always in for a little chance to code something. So instead of having an untrusted piece of hardware connected to the net, it will have access to intranet ONLY and a Raspi-ran app will do the bridge and present the camera live feed (as stills not video). 
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Python and Flask because it's a great combo for a small website
* OpenCV to access the IP Camera via RTSP protocol
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* An IP Camera (Amz is your friend) that supports RTSP
* Raspi
* A dynamic DNS ([[http://www.duckdns.org/]] is your friend ðŸ’›)
