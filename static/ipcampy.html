A lightweight web app in python meant to run on a raspi to show the feed from an IP Camera while forbidding the IP Camera itself to access/be accessed by internet.<br/>

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
I have an IP Camera at home, but I don't trust the software on it: easily hackable (purposedly or not), malware on it, etc. Don't want to take risks, plus I'm always in for a little chance to code something. So instead of having an untrusted piece of hardware connected to the net, it will have access to intranet ONLY and a Raspi-ran app will do the bridge and present the camera live feed (as stills not video). 
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Python and Flask because it's a great combo for a small website
* OpenCV to access the IP Camera via RTSP protocol
<h2>Points of pain: building OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi</h2>
Install on a PC with Ubuntu 20.4 is a breeze and quite fast (with a good CPU):
<pre>
#get python an pip
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pip --yes

#get flask
sudo python3 -m pip install Flask

#opencv for python
pip install opencv-python 
</pre>
... but, installing on a Raspi (and I'm masochist to I mean a Rpi Zero W) that is more complicated and VERY LONG. Like the final pip install triggers a build and it takes 2-3h to complete. And cherry on the sh*t cake is that opencv-python doesn't build (as of the moment I write these), you get an error "read cmake output" after HOURS. Reading further apparently it's a problem of memory so you need to allocate a lot more swap memory to the OS, otherwise it will just fail miserably.<br/>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* An IP Camera (Amz is your friend) that supports RTSP
* Raspi
* A dynamic DNS ([[http://www.duckdns.org/]] is your friend ðŸ’›)

For memory or if it helps anyone you can stream your RTSP camera stream to VLC and view on your PC and even save it as a video: <pre>vlc rtsp://(camera-ip):554/(streamName)</pre>
