Because 1 server 2 apps is sometime what you want.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
* Nginx is the proxy listening to port 80 and your 2 sites AAA and BBB will live behind the proxy in folders aa and bb
Ie: http://my-super-site.dot.com/aa => calls the site running on http://my-super-site.dot.com:12345 (that is app AAA)
<br/>
<br/>
To do that, setup NginX in front of both sites on the same server as a reverse proxy.<br/>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Step 1 : Nginx</h2>
Do like RTFM 1 : [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/deploying/nginx/]] <br/>
<br/>
EXCEPT that it's maybe better to :
* create an new file in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code>
* link it in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code>
* <u>Check</u> it would work <code>sudo nginx -t</code>
* Enable with a manly <code>sudo service nginx restart</code>
<h2>Step 2 : Flask</h2>
So though it works without telling Flask that it's behind a proxy, the makers of Flask say to do it so RTFM 2 : [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/deploying/proxy_fix/]]<br/>
<br/>
ADDITIONALLY :
* your intra-site URL must all be **RELATIVES** meaning in your site navigate like <code><A href="thatOtherPage">link</A></code> WITHOUT a leading / on the target URL or you'll end up at the root of your <i>http://my-super-site.dot.com/</i> and not in the /aa "folder" (the proxy redirection to your site)
<br/>
<br/>
One other option is to use flask URL processor to edit he URL dynamically : [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/urlprocessors/|link]].
<h2>Step 3 : block direct access to apps</h2>
Most likely you will not want to have your app accessible on http://my-super-site.dot.com:12345, so you need to block access from outside but not from the proxy.<br/>
WORK IN PROGRESS!<br/>
Not the answer alas: ufw deny in on eth0 to any port 12345 proto tcp
