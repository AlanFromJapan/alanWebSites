<img src="files/Fail_Logo.jpg" alt="Fail_Logo.jpg" title="Fail_Logo.jpg" style="width: 300px;" align="right" />Lucky me, I just bought last week a new and nice <em>Galaxy J</em> (knock off version of the Galaxy S5), but still. In a middle of a game, screen turns off, and the phone vibrates every 2 seconds. Charger plugged, unplugged, with battery, without battery, no change: black screen and reboots every 2 seconds.<br />
Quick check on internet, it's a known disease of the recent Samsung phones: the power button stays stuck. You have to open your phone and replace the tact switch... if you have american model. Being in Japan I have the pleasure to own a model that includes TV and for the which the tact switch is repaced by a cheapest kapton sandwich switch (see the pictures).<br />

A few other gentleman had the same problem and explained here hteir solution:<br />

<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Fixing"></a> Fixing </h1>
<ol><li>Open your phone by removing all the screws in the back</li><li>Pry the back open by sliding a plastic lever or driver along the screen</li><li>Remove the few last screws and unplug the daughter-boards</li><li>Unsolder the power button</li><li>Solder another one instead</li><li>Voila<ol><li>...at least that was the plan. It worked, minus a few rework, the power on is working again: solder the hair thin wire was a pain, assembling was tricky and I had to put some extra layers of tape to have the external button press at the right place. <strong>The big fail is that the 2 bottom haptic buttons don't work anymore</strong>. Don't know why, put all screws (ahum... minus one) in place but still doesn't work.</li></ol></li></ol><strong>Final status:</strong> an android phone with a power button that works but no haptic menu/back buttons. <span style="color: #ff0000;
