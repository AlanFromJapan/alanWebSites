This is a small library I made to fill my own egoistic needs in terms of parts. No guarantee whatsoever that they work but well I used them so it worked for me at least. Hope you may find it useful so please don't hesitate to use it.<br />

<ul><li>DS3231 : I found something in another .lbr file but it was not my format so I imported the existing and adapted to my needs<ul><li>SO16 : the small SMT package</li><li>SO16W : the wide one that is in fact the size of the DS3231 I had</li></ul></li><li>2 way solder pad : bridge to left or right. This exist also in the Sparkfun.lbr, I just noticed too late.</li><li>RGB SMT led : some led I found at Akizukidenshi, roughly 6mm x 6.6mm, 6 pins. no way I spend hours doing acrobatic soldering with that. Lets make a nice landing and solder it by hand but on a nice board.<ul><li>ＬＥＤ　ＳＬＣ－Ｆ２１９ＣＡ－Ｔ１ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gI-02225/" rel="nofollow">http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gI-02225/</a></li></ul></li></ul>
