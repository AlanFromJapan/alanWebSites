This is a new Template for **line chatbot**!

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
Started that in December 2016, idea would be a line chatbot that can do some domotics... First we'll work with the **Messaging API** of Line.
<h2>Points of interest</h2>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
* Create a **business account**, as a developer
* Make a **Channel**, but for that you'll need a **Provider**
* On the backend server, make a user //linebot// : sudo adduser --disabled-login linebot
* sudo pip install line-bot-sdk flask
* git clone https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-python
* Make yourself a DNS name, [[http://duckdns.org|Duck DNS]] is fantastic and free (thanks guys!)
* Now you need a certificate, so use certbot ([[https://letsencrypt.org/|let's encrypt]] thanks for your free service!) for that. I tried many options, but ended by using the manual method: //sudo certbot certonly --manual  -d myserver.duckdns.org// <br/> you'll need to run a parallel simple webserver, but it's all explained on the screen, just read it, you'll end up with you 2 .pem certificate files. You want that key file and your fullchain.pem that is stored in /etc/letsencrypt/live/myserver.duckdns.org/. You can use the privkey that is there too, it's the same as the key file you generated above.
* You should now be able to run the basic samples of Line, after editing the code as below to enable listening to outside request (host="0.0.0.0") and enabling the certificates:
<pre>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", ssl_context=('fullchain.pem', 'privkey.pem'))
</pre>
* Now go to [[https://developers.line.biz/console/|Line website]] and go to your channel then provider and edit the 2 webhooks settings:
* Use webhooks: set to //Enabled//
* Webhook URL: put the url of your callback service, ie <i>https://myserver.duckdns.org/callback</i> You can even test, though it fails for me with the sample "flask-echo" but it works when you call it by talking to your line bot!
Victory, as you're here, you have a beta prototype working. Good job, go grab a beer. Yes you can, you deserve it.
