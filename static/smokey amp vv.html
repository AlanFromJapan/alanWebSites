<i>Based on [[Smokey amp vIII]], the same circuit with minor additions. The main change is the details level and the lack of switch thanks to the usage of the mono jack Ring/Sleeve as a switch.</i><br/>
<br/>
For once I built a [[Smokey amp]] that is really in a cigaret pack. Still based on [[http://hackaweek.com/hacks/?p=131|Mr. Segovis of Hackaday]] design, a minor change is the reuse of the input jack as a power switch, a power led for the blingbling and a few components values that have changed.
