Trying again to make an [[Atomic Clock]] but with a [[https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/embedded-clocks-frequency-references/3961-sa-22c|Microsemi SA 22c]].

<h3>Connector</h3>
Ok let's start with problems from inception: the connector. The kind vendor sent me a used one (looking good) but it's a rare piece, a **SAMTEC TMMH-109-01-G-DV-ES-A 2 X 9 shrouded header**. And with a 2mm pitch, just to make things funnier.<br/>
I ended up making a custom board for it that will transform that precious SMD connector in a regular 2.54 pitch connector.<br/>

<h3>Power</h3>
That thing will need to be fed, a 15v and a 5v, at 18.5w max. So bought a nice 15V 3Amp power pack that will be largely sufficient. Now need to make a nice 5v out of it.<br/>
I will try to use the 2 steps technique to get a nice/ripple free 5v: use a high frequency switching mini board to get 15V to say 7-8V and then a LM7805 to reduce to 5v. The 2 steps will limit the amount of energy wasted as heat by the LM7805 but yet give the proverbial clean ripple free 5v. Of course efficiency wise it won't be great since we lose power in 2 stages, hopefully not more than with LM7805 only. Which I doubt since in tests I do run it without the switching board (feeding 15v to the LM7805) and it gets HOT, like you don't leave your fingers on ~= 60-70C with a little heatsink (not on the picture).<br/>

<h3>Heat</h3>
The thing is going to get hot to control the working temp of its scientific package. So I need to stick a fat aluminium radiator on it, but luckily aliexpress is hereâ™¡.<br/>
And without the heater indeed it gets pretty hot: you can still leave your fingers there though unpleasant so I'd say just below 60C after 10 mins. But vendor says heatsink so heatsink it will have.
<h3>Signal</h3>
The vendor said it was spitting 600Hz, couldn't go higher. Got to see in details.<br/>
The PPS_OUT (1Hz) is 400ns as announced:<br/>
