Trying again to make an [[Atomic Clock]] but with a [[https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/embedded-clocks-frequency-references/3961-sa-22c|Microsemi SA 22c]].

<h3>Connector</h3>
Ok let's start with problems from inception: the connector. The kind vendor sent me a used one (looking good) but it's a rare piece, a **SAMTEC TMMH-109-01-G-DV-ES-A 2 X 9 shrouded header**. And with a 2mm pitch, just to make things funnier.<br/>
I ended up making a custom board for it that will transform that precious SMD connector in a regular 2.54 pitch connector.<br/>

<h3>Power</h3>
That thing will need to be fed, a 15v and a 5v, at 18.5w max. So bought a nice 15V 3Amp power pack that will be largely sufficient. Now need to make a nice 5v out of it.<br/>
I will try to use the 2 steps technique to get a nice/ripple free 5v: use a high frequency switching mini board to get 15V to say 7-8V and then a LM7805 to reduce to 5v. The 2 steps will limit the amount of energy wasted as heat by the LM7805.
<h3>Heat</h3>
The thing is going to get hot to control the working temp of its scientific package. So I need to stick a fat aluminium radiator on it, but luckily aliexpress is hereâ™¡.<br/>
