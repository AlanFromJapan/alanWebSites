<h1>Laser engrave masking technique</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
Apply a mask to your blank PCB (paint) and remove the part to etch-out with [[laser burner on linux|your low-power laser]].
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* Blank PCB
* Can of black paint (mate if possible)
* IPA
* triple-zero iron wool
* Ferric Chloride
* gloves, goggles, etc
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>PART 1 : PREPARATION</h3>
Take your PCB, rub them thoroughly with iron wool until they shine. Then give them a nice rub-rub with IPA to remove dust and grime. Then don't touch them anymore with your greasy fingers.<br/>
Then give them a good layer of canned black paint (the mater the better). And then let it dry, the drier the better so wait a couple days to be on the safest side...
<h3>PART 2 : PCB design</h3>
Do your design normally, but follow the below rules (using Eagle):
* Limit yourself to **single side**. The less vias you have the less you'll have to wire on the back.
* Vias: default are small, make them bigger (1.5)
* DRC Rules - Clearance: set to **25mil** for all the **Different signals (all the wire only)**
* DRC Rules - Sizes: set minimum width at 0.5mm. It's fat but that is a minimum to ensure the wire is still here post etching.
<h3>PART 3 : PCB design transfer</h3>
Using Eagle and Lightburn:
* From Eagle export top layer + holes to image in monochrome (500DPI min)
* Import the image to Lightburn and adjust the size
* Burn settings: 15mm/s at 95%
<h3>PART 4 : Cleanup</h3>
* With **hot** water + **soap** (important) remove the remaining the burnt paint
* Wash GENTLY to not remove the rest of the paint mask
* Dry, then clean with some IPA and tissue. Important to ensure a good etching later!
<h3>PART 5 : Etching</h3>
Be safe, goggles, gloves, aeration (or do it outside) etc... Ferric Chloride is no joke. <br/>
Do not touch the board masking paint: it's not gone but minutes in acid made it easy to rub with your fingers: just touch the sides with non-metallic tools (lesson learnt the hard way).
* Use 100% Ferric Chloride (undiluted)
* Warm your solution to 40degrees (bain marie in closed container)
* Drop the board inside and with plastic/wood agitators, raise/lower the board to force some fresh solution. Ferric Chloride is quite siruppy and your contribution is needed.
* Depending on size and freshness of your solution, it might take 10 good minutes or more
* When all the copper is gone (check by transparency) then rinse the board thoroughly with water
<h3>PART 6: Final Cleanup </h3>
* Clean with water thoroughly
* Remove the remaining mask paint with steel wool and elbow grease (go easy and don't ruin what you etched)
* Finish cleanup with IPA and clean tissue
