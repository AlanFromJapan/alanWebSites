<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
<h3>Pros ðŸ˜†</h3>
* It's cheap.
<h3>Consã€€ðŸ˜¢</h3> 
* It has a quiescent consumption of up to 60mA (for doing nothing) which is BAD. So no portable / battery powered project with this.
* The adjustable resistor is VERY sensitive (it's 220k and has a swing of half a turn), and will drift
<h3>Learnt from experience</h3>
* It works as a "replacement" of a Li-Ion battery in a Nintendo DS but the DS is picky with the voltage. Must be closest you can from 3.7, a little more is ok otherwise the battery protection kicks in and the handheld refuses to start. That said, the MINI-360 delivers the necessary power for good function, so not a problem of the converter, just a thing to know.
<h2>Output formula</h2>
In case you want to replace the adjustable resistor with a fixed one, here is the formula:<br/>
<strong>ðŸ‘‰ Vout = 0.925*(R1 + R2)/R2</strong><br/>
If you fix R1 as 8.2k (the resistor is a teeny tiny puppy labelled "822"), then formula becomes: <strong>R1 = (8865* Vout - 8200)</strong><br/>
<br/>
See the truth table in yellow with fixed R2:<br/>

It's so much nicer if R2 would have been 10k...<br/>
<br/>
[[https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/parallel-resistor|OmniCalculator]] tells me that with a 33k and 100k resistor (that are in my resistor box) in parallel, I get 25k resistor equivalent, meaning 3.75 V on paper. Close enough.
