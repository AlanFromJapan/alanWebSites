Years (like 5) ago, I made a [[Gameboy homebrew cartridge]] that would double up as an EEPROM programmer. As a mix microcontroller and EEPROM it was doomed to fail, but I had hope for the EEPROM programming part. It never worked, disregarding how many times I fixed my code, read it, scratched my head, read the docs, read other people stuffs, ... never. So I gave up, and always had that thorn in my side since then (I'm not the kind of give up guy). Recently I resumed working on GB development, and used my EEPROM programmer and noticed that.. it works. The only weird bug is you have to 1) Erase the eeprom first (or program to 0xff - that I have to try) and 2) write an EVEN number of bytes otherwise I suppose the bus is left in a weird state. <br/>
  Ok sure that doesn't sing very high the quality of my code here I admit, but it did work. Do I added a few things, tested it more thouroughly, then made a Python program to communicate with it and there we are: I can upload and download ROMs on my EEPROM, and it just works.<br/>
  I will sleep the sleep of the just tonight.

Made another small USB board just received fromn Seeedstudio, the [[RapideUSBII]] that runs an ATtiny2313, has a couple of RGB leds ... worked out of the box, so happy.<br/>

Ok I resumed working on an old project: make my own Cartridge and game for Gameboy. The cartridge was a bit of a fail so far, so I put it on the side (like 5 years ago!) and so the game too. Now I just bought a cartridge where I can upload a ROM so I resumed the development. And as a good developper, I made a tool to make development : the [[GbReaper]]. Allows you to see a ROM, extract sprites, use the sprites to make "maps", and export it into a format that GBDK can compile. Then you have your background and sprites, you just have to start coding! Heavily WIP, but who knows where it could lead? At least it will allow me to cross out a "TODO" / childhood dream from the bucket list, and it's worth its weight in gold.<br/>

[[SNES pad USB adapter|SNES-to-USB adapter]] PCB sent for production. I forgot how pleasant it was to make PCB, I think I will make a couple more and send together for prod. At 5USD the board, the 15USD sending fees would hurt less if I can group. <br/>

Nothing new here: already done by others and legacy technology, but hey, it's my life and my site. Plus recently my son is a big Super NES player and those eBay 1 USD USB SNES lookalike joypad aren't par with the real thing. I have a few of them home, so let's make the [[SNES pad USB adapter|SNES-to-USB adapter]] for my Retropie console.

  I'm lucky to have a room for my electronic hobby, but the air doens't move much and after long soldering session it stinks and hurts your lungs (maybe psychosomatic). So maybe making a small air cleaner, with a fan and a HEPA filter? Too expensive to buy but make, maybe ...

That was fast, my [[Raspi WebRadio player]] is working just fine now! Ok a bit of tuning to do (power management mostly), but it's here. The hardware part is done, so is the speaker case itself. Works fine, though lots of white noise... meh, will be enough for a workshop AND it makes it sound like a real old time radio!! (in woodworking these happy incidents are called "rustic charm" :)<br/>

A long time dream came true: this year in my fukubukuro at [[http://akizukidenshi.com/|Akizukidenshi 秋月電子]] there was an oscilloscope probe. It was the message I was waiting for, I need to upgrade from that cheap (yet pratical) DSO probe (one of the first versions). So I got myself a small factor one for less than 30 USD: a [[DL1540|Yokogawa DL1540]] functional! Made in 1992, it's closing on its thirties, with a vintage orange on black CRT screen. 150 MHz 4 channels, though channel 1 is dead. Leaves 3, and I have 2 probles (yeah I bought another one) only so no problem. Surprisingly the battery is dead so I'll change that and put a few pictures one of these days.<br/>

Guess what, after finally replacing the eInk that died on my [[eInk Weather station]], 1 week later the weather provider changed the API and removed the per hour forecast permission from the free plan! After Yahoo!, now it's WeatherBit who's playing tricks on me. So I spent a few hours cleaning up the code (shame on me it was and still is ugly) and re-implementing the weather source API from [[https://openweathermap.org|OpenWeatherMap]]! Big thanks to them. <br/>
Format was somehow similar so 3h of work while watching youtube were enough (a best practice to guarantee quality code and high efficiency).

Found an old DS Lite in the closet for my son to play with but of course the battery was empty, and impossible to find the charger or an USB adapter. But I remembered an old technique, and after checking continuity with the battery pins, I just stucked 2 wires in the plug and fed it with the USB 5v. Not a long term solution but it does the job for tonight.<br/>
  Oh and I resumed (years after!) working on my [[Arduino Programmer]], basically just an [[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP|ArduinoISP]].<br/>

For my drillpress, I wanted a footswitch to keep my hands on the workpiece. So I bought a cheap footswitch and based on the [[Clapclap 1386]] board I made a smart foot switch : long press to start, short press to stop. The details are in the [[Clapclap 1386]] page.

My air conditionned is second hand like the house, and the remote bid us farewell. Luckily I have another Mitsubishi aircon for the which the remote works, but now I can use one out of 2 (I could turn both on but navigating between rooms with the remote is not fun). So should I buy again a remote (which failed first time because my aircon is an antique) or [[https://hackaday.io/project/165553-remoteduino|make one]]? I'd say the tipping point is 10USD: if a new working remote costs me less than that, I'll buy it. Let's see.
