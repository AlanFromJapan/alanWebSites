  I checked my memo on this present blog, and that's **10 years ago** I had the idea of a <a href="/gameboy clock.html#SerialMode">Gameboy Clock</a> and started working on it. It took me through SOOOOOOO many detours, learning, discouragement, revenge, ... and now it works. Strangely I feel nearly sad, though of course proud. Not sure this will have any further use than being shown to geek friends who visit home, but hell, that was quite a journey. Not sure to who I should say this but from my heart I want to say "thanks for the challenge, I deeply enjoyed it". On to new adventures?<br/>

  All the pieces work separately (so far!), now tying in stuffs nicely together. I'm on the GB side now, and once I have a visually appealing clock program, then I can go back to the PCB and implement the RTC reading. Did that already, should be a breeze but who knows. In the meanwhile, a couple hours of tile design and coding gave me that. Still need a bit more but moving fast (kudos to Copilot who's a valuable partner most of the time).<br/>

Never really cared for the sub-types of MCU and the letters, since it's usually just power ratings. But nooooooooo 328P<u>B</u> is a different beast, with special ID, not just a drop-in replacement. Fortunately it kinda behaves nicely if you're lucky (I was!) but it comes with a lot more of capabilities! Additional SPI, TWI, etc... [[https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/Atmel-42559-Differences-between-ATmega328P-and-ATmega328PB_ApplicationNote_AT15007.pdf|See the details here]].<br/>

  Isn't she a beauty? And (so far as per my tests) everything works flawlessly... hoping I'm not jinxing myself! As a dummy clock it works, so next is switching to the Gameboy for the "game", then will be back to the board to add a REAL RTC (DS1307 on this one), and then maybe USB etc. See all details here: <a href="/gameboy clock.html#SerialMode">Gameboy Clock (Serial)</a>.<br/>

	None of them are new per se, but they are for me. I decided to follow most of the amateur PCB designers and move away from Eagle (with a tear in my eye) because of the support stop in a few years and moved to **Kicad** v8. Easier than I thought and powerful! Just scratched the surface but happy I took the challenge even if it made making a simple board a lot longer. I will make a small USB gadget to emulate a mouse (and stop my PC to sleep), and to do that I ended up duplicating the [[https://github.com/sparkfun/AVR_Stick|Sparkfun AVR Stick]]. Just an [[Attiny85]] board, here I made my [[RapideUSB Mini]].
  
      <span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2024-03-14 - PCB solder stencil at home</span><br />  
  Just got the idea to save a few bucks when ordering PCB to make (simple) stencils at home. Afterall I know how to [[Homemade PCB|make my own PCB]]. So here's my receipe on how to make your own [[Homemade Solder Stencils]].<br/>

Well took me time to get back to it seriously, and the upgraded oscilloscope wasn't enough (it would have been retrospectively!) so I had to run my signal analyzer on a Win7 VM but it worked! A small sign inversion fixed, now can send and read to the GB at leisure. Now the ground work is done: need to enter the <a href="/gameboy clock.html#SerialMode">coding of the real thing</a>!<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh and while at it, I made a small [[Homemade PCB]] debugger board to help, which helped me improve my technique. Worked like a charm.<br/>

  I discovered (!) that you can make stickers for your GB cartridge! I had to make a couple, and with my limited artistic skills they do the job! Special sticker paper for laser printer, worked like a charm. Made a template in Inkscape for future reuse. <br/>

  I used my transition day at home and the jetlag to good use to test for the first time [[Homemade PCB]]s! Promising results for a first time, I got what I did right and what I did wrong, that can be a solution for SIMPLE boards.<br/>

I'm really close to have the RTC to GB communication right. It works now, but I have a synchronization issue so it doesn't work all the time. Pretty close though. Unfortunately this will all have to wait until March for I'll be away on biz trip and then vacation away from my workbench. Hoping to not lose the momentum !<br/>

  To avoid pluging my bench power supply (loud) I made a small power board: a Li-Ion battery from an old laptop, charger/protection module, step up module. Works fine but holly molly the output is noisy, like 1.6v noise P2P! Luckily a little 0.1uF cap that was lying on the desk made it more reasonable (~= 600mV P2P). Remember to use caps to filter high frequency noise!<br/>

  So yes I have a problem with clocks. Whatever. Years ago I tried to make an [[Atomic clock]] with a Rubidium Standard but I couldn't get it to work.<br/>
  Now trying again with another Rubidium Standard that seems simpler -Microsemi SA 22c- and that I'm sure works (the auction vendor showed pictures): so let's try again [[Atomic Clock Revisited]].
  
    <span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2024-01-29 - Gameboy Clock restarted</span><br />  
  I restarted on that project that originally drove me to GB dev like ... 10 years ago? I side track a lot, I know. So after meeting [[https://mdagois.gumroad.com/|Maximilien Dagois]] who works the other side of the street and have common friends with me (check his cool book on GB dev!!), I got the idea to not use a custom cartridge (that will be for next decade) but use a Serial connection or "Game Link" cable. Which allows to read/write data a bit at a time in a serial fashion.<br/>
  So I pulled a donnor half dead gameboy and an old board with a RTC and an Atmega ([[WordClock]] FTW) and ... it didn't work. I spent the week (meaning 4 hours spread over a week) to understand that the DS3231 had a failed soldered pad, fixed it with flux, heat and love, and it's back to life! Now on to the second part: connecting it to the GB serial port. Hardwired for now, I'll snip snip a donnor cable later. <br/>
  Long story short: progress people!!<br/>

  Too long I didn't do it, and found a bunch of old Li-ion batteries from wide range of provenance. Some of dead are absolutely dead, like fire-hazard level. Here's a pic for you. Look at that crack on that non-genuine replacement battery for PSP or how cushionny this other battery became...<br/>
  PS: you know the joke about the guy who cleans his desk and find a perfectly working NDS battery the day after he finished a project about an NDS that had no battery?<br/>

Bought a bunch of GB (NDS, color, pocket) last year or the year before, never got to fix them till now. Got one which battery was dead, and since the screen had small light issues plus the fact it is a original NDS (who wants them?) then I just had fun repairing it on the cheap and made it a USB-C wired one with a buck converter to emulate the battery. It works!<br/>

  I'm fixing some GameBoys, a first generation Nintendo DS to be precise and I'm looking at replacing the defunct battery with step-down (buck) converter. Yes the console would need to be plugged to work, but it doesn't boot without a battery and it's just for a test. I'm playing with a cheap module the [[MH-MINI-360]].

  Winter pushed me back to my old hobbies (and I'm finally getting over me Baldurs Gate 3 addiction) so I'm productive again. Made a small //for the fun// GameBoy game: [[RPGDice]]. Just rolls 8, 12, 20 faces dices for RPG. Nothing fancy, just a quicky project for the fun. Also changed servers so my good ol' faithful with its 1,008 uptime dates saw its days over.<br/>

  Making many apps is fun, but hosting them is a necessity and for the low volume of visite, one shared server will be more than enough. BUT many sites don't like to do that unless they are behind a proxy so let's do that and [[Setup Flask behind NginX proxy]].

For my [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/GrblWebStreamer|GrblWebStreamer]] (the stuff to pilot lasers from a Raspi) I wanted a module to "show" the GRBL content as an image. Though you find many systems doing that on the net, nowhere I could find a way to do that in Python, so I wrote it. It was simpler than expected but now it's done and shared with everyone (opensource etc) so go check [[https://pypi.org/project/grbl2image/|grbl2image on PyPi]]!<br/>

  So I've been hit again by a creativity surge, and work on (too) many stuffs:
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/GrblWebStreamer|GrblWebStreamer]] is working fine! Plug it, open your browser, upload the GRBL code and let it do the job while you do something else! Tested on jobs longer than an hour and worked all fine ☺️ Since yesterday I'm even making it message me on Line when job is completed (to be packaged properly)
* [[Laser burner on Linux]] is working fine, has its own enclosure and fans, just need to make some pictures.
* [[ipCamPy.nocv]] has progressed, you can see multiple cameras and zoom now. Next will be recording stills for a replay or timelapse, maybe add some movement detection/human/wild life identification? Not my forte that last area but gotta start somewhere.
* At work I'm working on making [[Linux on a stick]] for curious beginners, so I keep details here
  <img src="/files/ipcampy-screenshot1.jpg" width="400"/>

  <span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2023-03-29 - Laser Burner continued</span><br />  
  Now the laser works fine, enclosed and gives satisfaction. Ok 5W laser ain't much when we talk about cutting so patience and careful trial/error is needed but it is doable. Thing is it means having my laptop stuck to the machine for maybe an hour a time, and the fumes are nocives. Like acrylic: you know it's not good to cut it and smell it.<br/>
  So I'm making a small headless webservice that runs on a [[Raspi]] (Zero W most likely) and you upload your code there, run some quick tests via the web interface, click "Burn" and runaway while magic happens. Spend a few evenings on that last week, it does the job so far (of course security, edge cases are "for later"). Give it a look at [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/GrblWebStreamer|GrblWebStreamer]].<br/>

Laser Burner setup in progress, now it moves ... one axis only, the other one is stuck ... will get to that. Anyway for memory, this is [[How to update your DuckDNS dynamic DNS]]. I think I did that 10 times, never wrote it, always rediscover it, so future me: this is for you.

Still kids, still busy work and still no life, so barely no posts in a year. Anyway I was weak and bought myself a laser burner [[https://www.htpow.net/atomstack-p7-m30-laser-engraver|HTPow P7 M30]]. I started to make one years ago but never finished: I had a basic X-Y table, and //will// resume that project one day, but not now.<br/>
  Long story short, the setup on Linux and beginings aren't easy so I'll share it here for memory: [[Laser burner on Linux]].<br/>
