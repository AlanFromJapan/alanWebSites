It's hard to work at evening under the kotatsu with a small annoying -yet lovely- miniature human being trying to climb on you or type on your keyboard, but I made good progress on the [[eInk Weather station]]. In fact I got a piece of code working. It needs improvement, cleanup, scheduling and adding the additionals LED controls + using the [[RaspiPower]] to be called "completed", but we're getting there. All the Eink code part is completed now. Could it be finished by end of year? I need to make that containing box first, I'm still tinkering on the design ... stay tuned!

Wow 2 posts in one week, crazy... I found [[https://hackaday.com/2018/10/21/blazing-fast-raspberry-pi-display-driver-will-melt-your-face-then-teach-you-how/|this Hackaday article]] about an alternate driver for those cheap RPi ISP screens. I have one, it's indeed not very fast refresh. Ok for terminal, not really for game. That should be worth testing one day :)

 Back!</span><br />
...well, the site is. I still have so little time, but baby is cute, work is harassing but stimulating, woodworking is what I gotta do, boxing is when I have time. The site was down for maybe 4 months I think. One day my [[SNES Pi Webserver]] died, I don't know where the problem was, most likely the router but he was 13 years old so I can't blame him. I had no time to tinker about this, and while self hosting IS fun and I learned a lot through that project, we're in the cloud generation so here I am renting a VM for 5 bucks a month at DigitalOcean. I really like their service and can only recommend them if you aren't into the monsters Amz, Google & Azure. I just managed to spend a few hours in front of computer today to fix it. I don't imagine much content changes in close future but I do not forget my love for electronics and that will come back one day, I'm sure of it. In the meanwhile, if this is useful for you, that makes me happy. Cheers!

 Baby!</span><br />
Ok so now I'm a daddy with a baby at home and about no free creation time, which I dedicate to woodworking so ... But I found this project which I wanted to make, and that's great : [[http://michaelteeuw.nl/post/172694607802/activity-board-the-final-touch|a baby light and touch]]!

 eInk and GPS</span><br />
SO I'm still working on that GPS clock, now I noticed I need to put a RTC, and I soldered a DS3231, then I noticed I didn't ported the library for TWI and DS3231 ... so working on that. Other idea, a [[eInk Weather station]]. Bought the part, let's wait.
<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-10-17 - SNES controller to USB</span><br />
New idea: a [[SNES controller to USB]], because I got the SNES pads and I want to use them with my Retropie. I planned to do it, but I found a guy who did already everything top-bottom so... I'll just test and document.
<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-10-13 - GPS & Power (ctd)</span><br />
Finished coding the [[RaspiPower]] code for the [[Attiny10]]. Pretty happy, nearly worked from the start, no major problems just some tunings. All in assembler of course. Now I'll be working on integrating that to the [[Bedside mood companion]], and since wifey asked for a small furniture to the bedroom maybe make one stone two birds?<br/>
Immediately next however will be the [[Retropie Arcade controller]] and a (guess what) [[Arduino and GPS|GPS]] clock baptised [[ardReveil v7]].<br/>

After a long work weekend, I finally come back to the world of the living. I did a few things in the few free time I had, half asleep half sleeping:
* Playing with a [[Arduino and GPS|GPS module]], which in one week worked, stopped working, and then worked again ... (0_0;) well, for 5 bucks you get what you pay for. Will stick it anyway in a clock.
* My [[RaspiPower]] board arrived: I messed it up a bit, need a few air wires and only one type of Relay is accepted (makes me very happy of having planned it capable of using 2 types). I made a version 1.2 that should fix all issues, but I won't send it in production (at least not now) for I don't need it urgently and the 1.0 is fixable with a trace cut and a couple airwires.
* Prepare to make my own [[Retropie Arcade controller]] ... or so. Just a Raspi Zero, 2 pads in a box ... just need a nice box.
<br/>

Made a new board named [[RaspiPower]] that can use to turn ON and OFF your Raspi with a switch button only. Will be used in my [[Bedside mood companion]] once it become real.

2 electronics project completed this weekend and some woodwokring too! Woot woot !:
* [[SNES Pi Webserver]]: shutdown switch and the "page served" LED installed!
* [[Dust counter]]: completed with a nice led bar indicator
<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-09-03 -
 555</span><br />
I'm waiting for some generic PCB boards bought on eBay to wire the Led to the [[SNES Pi Webserver]] to make it nice. So I made a long overdue [[Rapide555]] for simple PWM. Not that I use that every morning but I did the design, and I wanted a small simple board to get back on the saddle with design. We'll see in a couple of weeks if I got it right.<br/>
So the list of projects that I should address:
* [[SNES Pi Webserver]]: make the board and install the shutdown switch and the "page served" LED
* [[Dust counter]]: the LCD used is WAY too dark to be readable, and the results the dust counter give are strange (bought another one in case)
* [[Alan Numitron Clock IV6]]: ok, I need to tackle this one. I made a v1.1 of the board, it was not working neither ... need to make this work.
* [[Bedside mood companion]]: promises to be nice

 First things first</span><br />
So the [[Raspi GPIO fun]] and the [[SNES Pi Webserver]] finally meet, working on having a LED blink on my SNES when pages are serverd. Prototype code is working now, multithreaded as should be. That will be the occasion too to cleanup the code and documentation, I have to admit it needed it. I will put the details here and there between the 2 pages linked above for the curious.

 Maniac</span><br />
Ok I didn't post for months at a time and now I post daily ... go figure. I think now my work is temporarily more stressful so I need another way to exorcise it. Following my previous post, it's a long time project layng in the back of my head: a [[Bedside mood companion]], a grand name for a bedside jukebox/alarm clock but hey, I make it so I name it.<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-08-23 - Raspi buttons and Radio</span><br />
Ok so the [[Raspi GPIO fun]] was quickly done: now I have a prototype that works and can blink LEDs and shutdown properly the Raspi. Will make a small PCB for that. And I found [[https://github.com/Edzelf/Esp-radio|that guy]] who made this web radio connector on an ESP8266! Sweet! Ok I wanted to do something like that, but I didn't imagine someone would have done it so neatly before. Definitely must look into that...

Since I had this poor little [[Raspi GPIO fun|Raspi Zero W]] laying around, I decided to give a try and play with its GPIO: I need a turn off button for my webserver, and adding some leds for the bling-bling when pages are served.<br/>


<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-08-20 - DNS.at.home</span><br />
[[DNS server at home]] completed! That was a long Friday evening but in a few hours I got it installed and running. Didn't do any performnance testing, but I can't say I feel any difference, better or worse. BUT now I can edit this site by typing [[http://website.at.home]] and that's much more cool than using the IP.<br/>


<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-08-16 - SonOFF a movie</span><br />
Finally used my [[SonOFF]] for a good reason: now it turns on and off my home file server and saves me energy and lifespan of servers. Great! Made me want to play a bit more with it ... what could I do? I also bought recently an HDMI 3.5 in screen for my Raspi 3 (works fine) ... can I do something combining both? I need a [[DNS server at home]], maybe a mission for one of these Raspi Zero I bought? (I buy too much stuffs, yeah)<br/>

Yeah well, I've been doing wonders in woodworking and nothing in electronics ... I guess we all have phases. Now that Mini-me is under production, I have a few months to make furnitures for him/her. In the meanwhile, a good friend of mine wants to build a Raspi 3 [[Retropie Arcade controller]] so I'm helping, I'll save in these pages whatever lesson learnt I get.<br/>

Got the family at home for 2 weeks, so not much to say. Now back to the real things. Bought another 10USD used drill, fixed the battery the same way and now I have [[drill battery from laptop battery|a nice 2 drills and 3 batteries]] powered on Li-Ion :) The [[Dust counter]] is having issues, we'll see to that soon.

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2017-04-19 - Aquarium dusts</span><br />
[[Aquarium lights]] is completed, see a little picture below ↓. Also, I started assembling my [[Dust counter]], and it's working fine ... ish. The dust detection seems to be working (there's a cabalistic calculation) but the LCD I found in my lucky bag is a bit capricious (now I guess why they were giving it away).<br/>

[[Aquarium lights]] is assembled, just need to put it in a box and glue the LED strips to the plastic roof I made the other day. I'm gonna make also a [[Rapide555]]
 board, since there's more than one place I could use a simple PWM.<br/>
I beat Chrome too! Since I edit my site via the web interface integrate, Google Chrome 57 decided that it will protect me from XSS attack and forbid me to edit any page having some javascript inside ... thank you. I edited the code of the python webserver to stop that (add a HTTP header //X-XSS-Protection: 0//).<br/>
Lastly, I wrote the long overdue [[alan numitron clock user manual|Numitron clock user manual]], in English and Japanese please. (I sold another one last week v(^。^)v)<br/>
Voila, wish you a good weekend dear reader.

My wife has an aquarium, I made a first version of the light with an ugly 5V, a boost converter and a strip of white led, and to my shame a resistor for the light diming. That worked, then humidity and water projections did its job on the copper connection on one end. Now time to fix this shameful project with a proper power source, 555 PWM and a MOSFET: enter the [[Aquarium lights]].

A friend gave me his big ass video card for a fix attempt: 800USD card (GTX 980 TI Gaming 6G), repair costs 500USD said the shop, so why not give a try instead of buiying a new one. Well, I opened the puppy, and after removing the protective shields I found a completely exploded chip! I took a picture for memory!<br/>
Otherwise I fixed a clock I made for a friend years ago which was not working. And as usual, the failed component was ... the crappy 5v power supply. So I just cut the cord, put a male USB cable, and we're in business for the next decade, as long as he has a USB charger somewhere.<br/>
With all these and the furniture making, the weekend was gone.<br/>

Pretty bad huh? But I have excuses: I moved, and my new house was more in need of a woodworker rather than an electronician. 2 months later, now we're out of the big job and we can move back to the electronic den time to time. So back to the [[Alan Numitron Clock IV6]]: scavenged what I could from the old failed board, now will solder back, plug it and cross fingers to see the magic happen... updates expected this weekend! I wish you all a very good week;)

I "fixed" that bug of the ESP8266 in the case of my [[SonOff]] experimentations when the ESP8266 cannot reconnect to your Wifi. I just ... ignore the status and consider that I'm connected anyway. And it works. I suspect my router to be the problem, seeing that it's not everybody who has that problem, so untill I change it we'll hope it works.<br/>
I bought a bunch of woodworking tools (axe, saw, chisels,...) at the Setagaya Boroichi flea market, that's cool. Will go again next winter.<br/>
Last but not least, I found what to do with one of those Raspi or Raspi clone and spare screen: a [[Magic mirror]]. Seriously, there's not enough weekends and nights in a week...

As I was working on the new board for the [[Alan Numitron Clock IV6]], I decided to route it all by hand. Problem is the grid that doesn't align with those SOIC 18, I ended with a patchwork of airwire because nothing would match... si I wrote a program to fix that (^_^). A small python program that matches existing wires and airwires if they are close enough : [[Eagle Grid Wiring Fixer]]. Works just fine, pretty happy. Give a try!<br/>
That was the success. The failure, is plugging that Raspberry 3 on a PC screen and using it as a graphical PC. Conclusion: it sucks! Raspi are great headless mini servers, I love them. But they aren't yet strong enough for a basic PC usage as I expect it: watching a movie, watching Youtube, watching the net... Youtube is doable in window mode, net is ok if you're not nervous and movies... well, I couldn't watch one with omxplayer and VLC was extra slow without HW acceleration.

So I'm moving to a new house in a few weeks, my house to be precise this time. One with a man-cave, a man-lab, etc... the dream! Since this site is hosted [[SNES Pi webserver|in my toilet]] it will have to move, which means a few day of interruption at worse. Maybe I'll try to move the site to of my cloud VMs, but I'm afraid I like it too much and leave it there... we'll see.<br/>
So not much activity planned in the coming days, more like packing and cleaning, sorting out the junk. I found a new stuff to do: an [[Air quality meter]]. The heart is dirt cheap, and I just happen to need one, with all that dust I make. I wish I knew the part was so cheap before, I'd have bought it years ago.<br/>
So about the [[BC05B Bluetooth module]] there's some noise that builds up somewhere, need to find where. And I need to make that board for [[Alan Numitron Clock IV6]] so it will arrive when I'm moving. ... I guess it will be a busy weekend. Cheers!

Well, I crapped up. My [[ardReveil v6]] boards arrived from Seeedstudio (very nice job guys!), I plugged everything and ... nothing happens. No lighting up. Scratch scratch my head, test, test again and in the latest desperate step, read the [[nixie tubes and alike|freaking page I wrote]] and yes... I need to use PNP and not NPN transistor ... (//face-palm//) (T_T)<br/>
Ok, so I'll try to tweak this circuit a bit, and since anyway even if it would work (which I doubt), it would be an ugly mess of wires, so I'll make a corrected version of the board and send to production in a few days ... A good reminder lesson : don't assume you remember, just **read the freaking doc** //that you wrote// (←the most innerving point).<br/>
At least, my [[Decade counter viewer]] arrived and it works flawlessly, which is a small compensation of my self deprecation.

That little [[BC05B Bluetooth module]] worked, then decided to frustrate me. I used the good old approved technique: let it stew for a week, and check from the ground up. And guess what, //someone// made a small and -to be honnest- invisible short between the VOL+ and BACK pin, that rendered the module mute and noisy. A bit of scratching and heating after, it's working back as new now. A small mountain of hot snort later, it's going to find its place in the stereo tomorrow morning (I will stay on the feeling of victory for tonight).

[[USB Volume control]] box is carved (in cypress) and the button is made of pao-santo, but not very round... it's ok but I think I will improve it this weekend. In the meanwhile I read on the net and found out another thing to do: an [[FFT Viewer]] working with a microphone. A microcontroller, a led matrix, a mic and an ampop and you're good to go and guess what: I have them all laying around! Also I bought some CD4017 and led bar graphs, but wiring is soooo messy (pins aren't aligned) that I decided to make a small pcb for it. This is the last 5 days week of work for me this year, I'll be looking forward to the weekend!

[[USB Volume control]] electronics, programming and assembly is finished, now "just" need to make a nice case. In wood, goes without saying (^_~). My work is s hard recently that I'm deeply relieved to abstract myself in creation. I wish you all to know the same feeling (minus the stressful work if you can). Have a good weekend, dear reader.

Hum... apparently I did something wrong and lost a week of status update. Anyway. Working on the [[USB Volume control]] (circuit defined, todo assemble and box), the [[Atomic clock]] is a problem because it warms up but does not lock, and that old time dear [[ardReveil v6]] saw a new board made and sent to production to China! Working a lot these days before the move to another part of Tokyo.
<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2016-11-27 - Working the atomic clock</span><br />
Opened my Rubidium standard to make the [[Atomic clock]] and plug stuffs. First bad (?) surprise, seem I have an updated version, schematics I find on the net are same-same-but-different. I did a first wiring to test the powerup: it powers up, heating works fine, goes down after some time, but no lock it seems... is the unit broken or did I miss something? Too early to say. I'll completely unsolder that connector instead of acrobatic soldering, see if it make things better.<br/>
Other side project will be another [[drill battery from laptop battery|Li-Ion power drill]] from Yahoo auctions and a [[USB volume control]]. Trying to recycle some old old laptops to run lightweight linux, so far with not much success.
<br/>

My [[drill battery from laptop battery|Li-Ion power drill]] is **finished**! Hehehe quite hapy. It's not charging fast, but it's charging properly. I'll keep an eye on it the first time it charges the drill battery, in case. Very happy of the result, I'll upgrade another drill I bought for 5USD on yahoo auctions. Just need to make a nice box for this puppy.<br/>
And now? Well it's time, for that long time delayed [[Atomic clock]]!

As forecasted, my [[drill battery from laptop battery|Li-Ion power drill]] is close to be finished. Battery connector and 85% of the circuit. Just 20 wires left to solder and a small program to write, we should be good very soon.<br/>
Just reposting a [[http://hackaday.com/2016/11/03/specifications-you-should-read-the-nasa-workmanship-standards/|Hackaday news]], I discovered there the fantastic documentation of the NASA: [[http://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/frameset.html|just read it]], it's great.<br/>

Talking 'bout a loose of momentum! 2 months without posts ... tsk tsk tsk. Well this summer was busy: I worked on a table for home (half of which is drying now next to me), visited France, India and I'm packing for Singapore. No much electronic, but I will get back to it pretty soon, especially since my [[drill battery from laptop battery|Li-Ion power drill]] will need a charger soon. <br/>
In the meanwhile I made an album on Google Photo (which is not as bad as I thought) for my wookworking adventures: for the curious people, it's here: <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/SbE1AJM1GbDTStnV6">https://goo.gl/photos/SbE1AJM1GbDTStnV6</a><br/>
So plan is to do 2 projects in October: the drill charger and the table. Crossing fingers! Wish you a great autumn to all.<br/>

So the ESP8266 took more than a month to arrive, made me loose my momentum. I've been more woodworking these days (^_^) Maybe a sort of leg-rest furniture with reclaimed wood, made also a drawer on wheels for under my sofa. I love woodworking too. Now I'm looking at that charger for the [[drill battery from laptop battery|battery of my drill I made from recycled laptop battery]]. Going to old Europe for some time, so will be an occasion to focus on electronics design and catching up on Game of Thrones reading... For those in summer, wish you a good one!<br/>

Still working on that cursed [[Kodi-XBMC remote]], I got the buttons, and [[ATtiny13]] speaking serial ... and now that stupid ESP8266 gives me the strangest bug: you can send 1 http request, you can send 2 http request, but after that: naugh. Niks. Nada. Rien. It refuses to send requests. If you restart it, then it works again, 2 times and gone... WTH am I doing wrong? Shall I rewrite this //again// and give up Lua for a arduino port to the ESP8266 ([[http://platformio.org/|platformio]] thing)? I'm really that close to buy that 4USD remote on ebay...<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2016-04-26 - Cheap 3.5 in screens</span><br />
Bought one of these cheap screens on eBay for 10USD, the ones that you plug onto a [[Raspi]]. And oh surprised, it works just fine from the start! Seriously, I installed a driver, but maybe it was already there from the start. A great surprise. Ok, it's SPI so you won't play movies or games, but for console it's just ok. Plus seems you can write in the Framebuffer, that looks fun ... provided one day I can compile that python lib FbPy.<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2016-04-17 - Finished with the FSM</span><br />
That [[Kodi-XBMC remote]] went the LUA way in the end, so I installed a javascript mode for syntax highlighting ([[https://highlightjs.org/]]). Works fine, so now just have to code it. (PS: I don't think I'm going to like Lua)<br/>
Also I tried to fix my team's video project which claims that one of its fan is not running... which is wrong. I shorted the temp sensors, no success. I measured the tachymeter output, a nice signal for 2 of them and a strange 10v centered +/- 3v for the big one next to the lamp. I ordered a "similar" one on eBay (12v 0.85a 5cm fan), let's see if we can solve the problem with a 300 JPY part.<br/>
And I bought a 1 JPY ('love auctions) car dvd player screen, I'm trying to figure out how to inject composite signal inside. Already found power, the baby starts. And I already shocked myself with the inverters for the backlight (not a very pleasant feeling). There's 9 pins, 2 are power, remains 7 among which 2-3 must be the composite. More on that later...<br/>

The [[Kodi-XBMC remote]] made a few progress but not in the right direction! I even wrote a Finite State Machine FSM to detect messages, but there is so much noise, I even get false positives with a 4byte message (means 32 false positive on the row!). Ok, I get most (not all) of the correct signal, but still, I don't want the thing to pause my movie in the middle of the action randomly. So came plan B: use a [[Arduino and ESP8266|ESP8266]] ! I have a couple bought for testing a few months ago, XBMC runs a web server as a remote, should just need to join the main NW wifi and send HTLP request to the web interface. Easy peasy! Is it? Wait and see ...<br/>

<span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2016-03-27 - Playing with oranges</span><br />
I resumed playing with my [[Orange Pi]], with more success this time. Used the [[http://www.armbian.com/|Armbian]] distribution, works much better. Still no wifi but all the rest works fine so, maybe I'll leave it as is and use the ethernet. Maybe even try to set up a owmCloud solution?<br/>
The [[Kodi-XBMC remote]] makes few progress because the communication between those 2 dirt cheap module is bad, simply very bad. I even made now some code with a Finite State Machine to detect the messages in the signal. Making progress though, but didn't imagine it would be that difficult to read through the tremendous amount of noise :/ Don't feel lucky with my choices of projects these days...<br/>

I spent my Saturday at home because of prod problem (not our fault but we were impacted). I could code something I wanted to do for a long time: create a **file upload function** for my web engine (which runs this site). It is now done! You can even upload multiple files at once ! Kinda happy. Go and check my [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanWebSites|GitHUB]]. As a proof of my status and to use my new function, here's how I feel :<br/>

[[Kodi-XBMC remote]] is making some progress. Got the basic setup, need to stabilize the communication with error checking and so one because the cheap 433MHz stuff are really sensible to noise. Like crazy sensible. But I'm gonna teach it who's the boss ;)<br/>

Finally instead of the [[Gameboy housing a DS|Gameboy in a gameboy]], which I know I'm as about to finish as certain that once completed I will leave on the shelf, I'll work on my [[Kodi-XBMC remote]]. I had a nice app on my cellphone, it is still but the app isn't reachable anymore since last OS upgrade on the lock screen. Having to unlock my phone to pause for instance is mighty annoying... you said "pretex to build a new contraption"? Yes :D<br/>

Started a [[Smokey amp vV]] for my friend Kento, who gave me a superb jacket and that I should really thank. Since he's a musician ([[http://www.discogs.com/artist/1774370-The-Tabloid-Play|the Tabloid Play]]), I hope he will appreciate. Based aroung an LM386 it's a pretty standard clear sound amp. Still in the making phase.<br/>
On the dev side, I'll be working on making a nice and easy function to upload pictures: copying files by scp then moving them, changing the rights etc... is too annoying.<br/>

Long time without update: I was busy with work, end of year blues, woodworking project and Fallout 4. I sold my [[SeaPhone]]! Quite happy, I'm supposed to go to post office later today to send it. The [[Gameboy housing a DS]] is pretty well advanced, in fact in the last steps and I'm stalling since I want to be sure I don't miss. My wooden desk is completed and quite a success :) I have no immediate next project, but my todo list is just asking for it so I'll let it mature a couple of weeks.<br/>
Voila, best wishes for you dear reader.<br/>

No update on the news for some time, so let me update you. I finished the first version of my [[SeaPhone]]. It's nice, I'll see it on internet as soon as I take a nice set of video/pictures. I have the mp3 modules from eBay for the v2: very nice stuff for less than 500 JPY. More on that later...<br/>
So I decided I'll use a new rythm (because my professional workload is awful this month and the next won't be better): 2 projects at a time only, one electronic (silent, for weekdays evenings) and one woodworking (weekend and powertools - hi neighbours!):
* Electronic: [[Gameboy housing a DS]]. I have the DS, an empty GB brick, a GBA emulator cartridge ... just a matter of clever fitting.
* Woodworking: a desk for my wife piano... maybe I'll make a page about that later.

I recently updated my site to have a login/pwd and an **online edit mechanism**, yes, like you'd find on pro sites :) Kinda happy, woking fine now. It's all as usual on the [[https://github.com/alanfromjapan/alanwebsites|github of the website]]. Still on test on dev site for now, but once I'll have tested it a bit more it will move to prod and make my life much more easy.<br/>
Oh and I received my new toy, a [[Orange Pi]]! Didn't had time to install/test, but that will come within this week. In the meanwhile I started a page to keep track of my experiments.<br/>

So the hosting continues, it works fine, Flask behaves like a good boy after a few tuning, to make it multithreaded for instance. I started working on a wiki-like page edition that does not forces me to log on to my server and edit with emacs (though I love my emacs). Not much time these days so it moves slowly, but made some progress. More on that later.<br/>
Started a new project, a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="SeaPhone.html">SeaPhone</a> which is a art (as in no real life purpose) project: old rotary phone, you pick up and hear the sea. Cherry on the cake is that if you dial some numbers you can change what you hear, or maybe prerecorded messages?<br/>

The deed is done, I put a redirection message on all the pages of my original site (kalshagar.wikispaces.com) to the present site. Apparently it's not really working, got about 10 visits a day (lol) but the legacy site is also being deserted with only 50ish visits a day. Need to start again to have more visits. And this goes by 1) making quality contents and 2) getting exposure in geeks sites (hackaday, electronics-lab, ...) Quite a work. But I'm not in a rush. Recently since I'm a bit dry on new ideas, I'll try to revisit old projects that failed or were abandonned for whatever reason:
<ul>
  <li><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="Gameboy homebrew cartridge.html">Gameboy homebrew cartridge</a> and check why that Flash can't get written properly</li>

The days of hosting on Wikispaces are drawing to an end. I'm going to self host, not with a dedicated VM or site hosting solution, but with a Raspi2 and an old router that was in my closet. Made a DMZ setup, configured router, locked down the Pi inside the DMZ, put all in an old Super Famicom and now it's in my toilet (so if you think this site stinks you'll know why). I finished the setup recently, need to dump the latest version of the site and off we go.<br />

My <a class="wiki_link" href="Finger%20Password%20Keyboard.html">Finger Password Keyboard</a> has well advanced over the weekend (I was off the country for 2 weeks and drown with the rest of the time): now it emulates a keyboard AND can record your fingerprint AND recognize it AND upon recognition send key strokes to your PC! Youhou!! The scanner gets quite hot (~50 C) so I used a PNP transistor as a switch to turn it off but ... for an unknown reason it's always on. Something I'm missing. Anyway that was cherry on the cake so I will maybe just ignore this. Need to finish the box and buy nice buttons, make a quick and dirty version I'll need to manually reprogram when I change my passwords and maybe (we know that it is an euphemism for <em>never</em>) I will make a version you can program like the <a class="wiki_link" href="Tricolor%20USB%20alert.html">Tricolor USB alert</a> which by the way works perfectly in my office for months now (^_^)v<br />

Tomorrow I start my tenth Japanese year... quite happy :) As per the electronics, yes I must admit I'm more woodworking than electrogeeking, but I'm used to this pattern. I know the autumn fresh nights will bring me back to the electronic desk. In the meanwhile I still work on my <a class="wiki_link" href="Finger%20Password%20Keyboard.html">Finger Password Keyboard</a>. As of today I can have a USB emulation on one end and on the other side I have a serial communication to the scanner module...

Seriously, what was the probability that a guy did the same thing at the same time and finished before me ? (T_T) Ok good, he managed to emulate the GB cartrigdge and another guy put a flash memory instead of the cartridge, so my project becomes no more inovative like I thought, but a "one more GB hacking" ... really guys you killed the buzz.

Colleagues told me I should emphasis the "old russian" look  of the <a class="wiki_link" href="Alan%20Numitron%20Clock.html">Alan Numitron Clock</a>. Does it mean something to you? I thought I could go steampunk with a copper box (short cut are guarantee though) and a few brass stuff - gears, screws, wires- I could solder on it ... maybe I'll give a shot later. <br />
The <a class="wiki_link" href="Laser%20cutter.html">Laser cutter</a> you ask ? Well, buying Dead Space 3 put a serious hit on productivity but the Xenomorph aren't everything. Now the former scanner bed motor works : a nice bipolar stepper motor (96 steps a turn), and I'm happy that I did as usual and bought a second<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/110953019447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cheap full H bridge</a>  (yup, ULN2003 aren't any good for bipolar I read).

I got comments from friends that a transparent plastic casing would be nice : so be it, let's give a try.<br />
<a class="wiki_link" href="Laser%20cutter.html">Laser cutter</a> was paused a little but is on his own way : I can control the former printer head now and I can measure it's position.

Well ... dunno why it doesn't work. I tried different approaches, mixed assembler and C, rewrote everything in assembler, spent hours debuging and still doesn't work. Worse, I nearly feels it worked better before all this assembler adventure. It's really frustrating to feel that you're so close to the goal, you know it's in your reach, you know there's a bug too, right in front of your eyes and can't find it. Damned... Maybe I'll leave it on the side for some time and come back later?<br />

Painted, assembled and it fits all nicely inside the cabinet. The controller ... ah the controller ... well it doesn't work. In fact seems the timing is wrong, like everything is shifted, some button reacting like 2 buttons. The answer may lay in the fact that I changed the function to read and send the button status, and that it might take too much time to answer according the timing (every 6 us). Or it's something else. I'll practice my <a class="wiki_link" href="Atmel%20assembler.html">Atmel assembler</a> skills, in case.<br />

After a few trial and errors, I finally read <em>with attention</em> the sample circuits of my NJM2073D and noticed that I was missing a cap between opamp(-) and GND. Tadaaa♪ now we have the sound too. The boards from China are in the mail, should be here in 1 week. This leaves me time to finish the cabinet (need just front screen) and we can start the (sand/paint)^3 phase...<br />

After a long pause on <a class="wiki_link" href="Around%20a%20SNES.html">Around a SNES</a> of 2 months and lots of mistakes, wrong ideas, ... I restarted from the begining. Use 2 interrupts INT0 and INT1 to detect latch and clock precisely. And found a bug in some "trivial" piece of code. Let me remind you (and me!) :<br />
<ul><li>DDRx : directions of the port x (1 = out, 0 = in)</li><li>PORTx : value of the port x for writing (used for pullups also)</li><li>PINx : value of the port x when reading</li></ul><br />

My arcade <a class="wiki_link" href="Around%20a%20SNES.html">SNES controller</a>  is on good track after a big pause, lots of silly mistakes too... this time I can say I was happy to have <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/dso-nano-v2-p-681.html?cPath=174" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a small oscilloscope</a>  !

Why are those babies so hard to find ? A 16 outputs PWM driver, that's so cool... but why is there only that IC on the segment (16 outputs and thoughhole) and why can we just buy it at Digikey or eBay HK ? The first one is terribly expensive from Japan, the second one is, well, eBay : the best and the worse. I have my project of <a class="wiki_link" href="Avalanche.html">Avalanche</a> that is waiting for 2 month that those damned 2IC arrive ... grrrrrr!<br />

You knew we could control a 74HC595 with 2 wires ? Needed 3 to my knowledge but some gentleman on the internet seems to do it with 2, by wiring together clock and latch ... At least the schema says so. Good to know.<br />
