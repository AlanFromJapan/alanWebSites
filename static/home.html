  I restarted on that project that originally drove me to GB dev like ... 10 years ago? I side track a lot, I know. So after meeting [[https://mdagois.gumroad.com/|Maximilien Dagois]] who works the other side of the street and have common friends with me (check his cool book on GB dev!!), I got the idea to not use a custom cartridge (that will be for next decade) but use a Serial connection or "Game Link" cable. Which allows to read/write data a bit at a time in a serial fashion.<br/>
  So I pulled a donnor half dead gameboy and an old board with a RTC and an Atmega ([[WordClock]] FTW) and ... it didn't work. I spent the week (meaning 4 hours spread over a week) to understand that the DS3231 had a failed soldered pad, fixed it with flux, heat and love, and it's back to life! Now on to the second part: connecting it to the GB serial port. Hardwired for now, I'll snip snip a donnor cable later. <br/>
  Long story short: progress people!!<br/>

  Too long I didn't do it, and found a bunch of old Li-ion batteries from wide range of provenance. Some of dead are absolutely dead, like fire-hazard level. Here's a pic for you. Look at that crack on that non-genuine replacement battery for PSP or how cushionny this other battery became...<br/>
  PS: you know the joke about the guy who cleans his desk and find a perfectly working NDS battery the day after he finished a project about an NDS that had no battery?<br/>

Bought a bunch of GB (NDS, color, pocket) last year or the year before, never got to fix them till now. Got one which battery was dead, and since the screen had small light issues plus the fact it is a original NDS (who wants them?) then I just had fun repairing it on the cheap and made it a USB-C wired one with a buck converter to emulate the battery. It works!<br/>

  I'm fixing some GameBoys, a first generation Nintendo DS to be precise and I'm looking at replacing the defunct battery with step-down (buck) converter. Yes the console would need to be plugged to work, but it doesn't boot without a battery and it's just for a test. I'm playing with a cheap module the [[MH-MINI-360]].

  Winter pushed me back to my old hobbies (and I'm finally getting over me Baldurs Gate 3 addiction) so I'm productive again. Made a small //for the fun// GameBoy game: [[RPGDice]]. Just rolls 8, 12, 20 faces dices for RPG. Nothing fancy, just a quicky project for the fun. Also changed servers so my good ol' faithful with its 1,008 uptime dates saw its days over.<br/>

  Making many apps is fun, but hosting them is a necessity and for the low volume of visite, one shared server will be more than enough. BUT many sites don't like to do that unless they are behind a proxy so let's do that and [[Setup Flask behind NginX proxy]].

For my [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/GrblWebStreamer|GrblWebStreamer]] (the stuff to pilot lasers from a Raspi) I wanted a module to "show" the GRBL content as an image. Though you find many systems doing that on the net, nowhere I could find a way to do that in Python, so I wrote it. It was simpler than expected but now it's done and shared with everyone (opensource etc) so go check [[https://pypi.org/project/grbl2image/|grbl2image on PyPi]]!<br/>

  So I've been hit again by a creativity surge, and work on (too) many stuffs:
* [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/GrblWebStreamer|GrblWebStreamer]] is working fine! Plug it, open your browser, upload the GRBL code and let it do the job while you do something else! Tested on jobs longer than an hour and worked all fine ☺️ Since yesterday I'm even making it message me on Line when job is completed (to be packaged properly)
* [[Laser burner on Linux]] is working fine, has its own enclosure and fans, just need to make some pictures.
* [[ipCamPy.nocv]] has progressed, you can see multiple cameras and zoom now. Next will be recording stills for a replay or timelapse, maybe add some movement detection/human/wild life identification? Not my forte that last area but gotta start somewhere.
* At work I'm working on making [[Linux on a stick]] for curious beginners, so I keep details here

  Now the laser works fine, enclosed and gives satisfaction. Ok 5W laser ain't much when we talk about cutting so patience and careful trial/error is needed but it is doable. Thing is it means having my laptop stuck to the machine for maybe an hour a time, and the fumes are nocives. Like acrylic: you know it's not good to cut it and smell it.<br/>
  So I'm making a small headless webservice that runs on a [[Raspi]] (Zero W most likely) and you upload your code there, run some quick tests via the web interface, click "Burn" and runaway while magic happens. Spend a few evenings on that last week, it does the job so far (of course security, edge cases are "for later"). Give it a look at [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/GrblWebStreamer|GrblWebStreamer]].<br/>

Laser Burner setup in progress, now it moves ... one axis only, the other one is stuck ... will get to that. Anyway for memory, this is [[How to update your DuckDNS dynamic DNS]]. I think I did that 10 times, never wrote it, always rediscover it, so future me: this is for you.

Still kids, still busy work and still no life, so barely no posts in a year. Anyway I was weak and bought myself a laser burner [[https://www.htpow.net/atomstack-p7-m30-laser-engraver|HTPow P7 M30]]. I started to make one years ago but never finished: I had a basic X-Y table, and //will// resume that project one day, but not now.<br/>
  Long story short, the setup on Linux and beginings aren't easy so I'll share it here for memory: [[Laser burner on Linux]].<br/>

Kids received a [[Lego Mario]] from a way too generous friend, and since they don't play much with it (can you believe that) I thought maybe I can reuse it? Let's see...<br/>

Ha! I got my domain back! I was victim of my lazyness and of "Domain Drop Catching" last year and me electrogeek.cc domain was stolen and made available to purchase for 200 USD (normally it's ~5USD/year). So I didn't pay (eat dirt you subhuman) and moved to electrogeek.tokyo. <br/>
  Today in meeting I was bored and checked and discovered: the domain was free again! I took it and reserved it for the foreseable future. I set it as an alias so now we can reach here from BOTH URLs! v(^_^)v<br/>
  <br/>
  Otherwise I continued resuming my Gameboy projects, now have migrated [[GbReaper]] to its own repo in Github and really improved it (stability and useability mainly). Also worked a bunch on [[MysticSnake]] and now we have AI, hit points, and loooooots of bugfixes. Seriously it's getting close to be useable. I now start to think of what kind of story I want to tell and to design levels (after all these efforts for creating the map randomizer...).
  
  <span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2022-08-02 - Gameboy</span><br />
Vacation at in-laws and I found a little motivation to resume GB coding of my "RPG engine" (what a pompous name). Now we have random room generation, moving on maps, collision detection, basic basic AI, ...making baby steps a couple of late night hours of coding at a time.<br/>
  The only BIG problem is the tile/map designer that I wrote years ago in C# is BAD but working fine enough to use but runs only on windows (normally I'm on linux now) and doesn't play well with wine. I'd need to port it to something more "recent" but my C# days are far away, and spending countless hours of the little time I steal on my sleeping time to just redo something that works is depressing me. And recoding all in python looks fun but again: months of late evening work to just get something that works the same?      
  
 <span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2022-06-03 - ipcampy a small website to see IP Camera (III)</span><br />
Oooook so OpenCV install drove me nuts so I gave up the original [[ipCamPy]] (which works, no problem but uses OpenCV) and forked the dev to [[ipCamPy.nocv]] which is the same goal but using other libs simpler to install on a lightweight Raspi ZeroW.
  
 <span class="alannews2"><img src="/files/news-avatar.200120.png" alt="news-avatar.200120.png" title="news-avatar.200120.png" style="width: 80px;" /> 2022-04-26 - ipcampy a small website to see IP Camera (II)</span><br />
  So the [[ipCamPy]] app works, for all it takes it was finished in one evening of coding, but installing on a RaspiZeroW is a nightmare. You need OpenCV on the Raspi zero and to install it you have to build it, and that takes hours... tens of hours. And fails, unless you follow a properly defined incantation (different version exist) and setup etc. 
  Well patience ain't my strong suit, so I will get back to that one day.

Bought an IP Camera for the house but to be honest I'm too cautious to let it access(ible) the internet: between the hacks and limited trust I have in cheapo closed-code firmware, it's a risk I don't want to take. There it is connected to the home network but not the internet.<br/>
  Then came the idea: can I make a small web app that would run on a faithful raspi <3 that I could harden against any attack yet let me see the camera feed? <br/>
  There was born [[ipcampy]].<br/>

  Now that little me #2 goes into a workable sleep pattern, I get a little free time to reconnect with my old hobbies, electronics being one. So I bought this transformer on Yahoo Auctions Japan for 10 USD, 1978 glorious Japan engineering in all its beauty! Will it work? Will I fry my amp? Will I kill my oscilloscope? Will I set fire to something? Stay tuned ! :D<br/>

  Hi all, long time no update: new job, second kid, other hobbies, etc. ... and when I went back I noticed my domain has been "stolen". With quotes, because it was not litterally stolen but victim of my laziness (didn't check that mailbox where the DNS company told me it was about to expire) and of a "petit trou du cul" (in French) who use the occasion to do some "Domain Drop Catching" and register it just after my grace period. So long story short, I don't want to pay 200 USD to get that domain name back because I think what was done was a di*k-move, we are now on "[[http://electrogeek.tokyo|Electrogeek.TOKYO]]".

Years (like 5) ago, I made a [[Gameboy homebrew cartridge]] that would double up as an EEPROM programmer. As a mix microcontroller and EEPROM it was doomed to fail, but I had hope for the EEPROM programming part. It never worked, disregarding how many times I fixed my code, read it, scratched my head, read the docs, read other people stuffs, ... never. So I gave up, and always had that thorn in my side since then (I'm not the kind of give up guy). Recently I resumed working on GB development, and used my EEPROM programmer and noticed that.. it works. The only weird bug is you have to 1) Erase the eeprom first (or program to 0xff - that I have to try) and 2) write an EVEN number of bytes otherwise I suppose the bus is left in a weird state. <br/>
  Ok sure that doesn't sing very high the quality of my code here I admit, but it did work. Do I added a few things, tested it more thouroughly, then made a Python program to communicate with it and there we are: I can upload and download ROMs on my EEPROM, and it just works.<br/>
  I will sleep the sleep of the just tonight.

Ok I resumed working on an old project: make my own Cartridge and game for Gameboy. The cartridge was a bit of a fail so far, so I put it on the side (like 5 years ago!) and so the game too. Now I just bought a cartridge where I can upload a ROM so I resumed the development. And as a good developper, I made a tool to make development : the [[GbReaper]]. Allows you to see a ROM, extract sprites, use the sprites to make "maps", and export it into a format that GBDK can compile. Then you have your background and sprites, you just have to start coding! Heavily WIP, but who knows where it could lead? At least it will allow me to cross out a "TODO" / childhood dream from the bucket list, and it's worth its weight in gold.<br/>

Nothing new here: already done by others and legacy technology, but hey, it's my life and my site. Plus recently my son is a big Super NES player and those eBay 1 USD USB SNES lookalike joypad aren't par with the real thing. I have a few of them home, so let's make the [[SNES pad USB adapter|SNES-to-USB adapter]] for my Retropie console.

  I'm lucky to have a room for my electronic hobby, but the air doens't move much and after long soldering session it stinks and hurts your lungs (maybe psychosomatic). So maybe making a small air cleaner, with a fan and a HEPA filter? Too expensive to buy but make, maybe ...

That was fast, my [[Raspi WebRadio player]] is working just fine now! Ok a bit of tuning to do (power management mostly), but it's here. The hardware part is done, so is the speaker case itself. Works fine, though lots of white noise... meh, will be enough for a workshop AND it makes it sound like a real old time radio!! (in woodworking these happy incidents are called "rustic charm" :)<br/>

A long time dream came true: this year in my fukubukuro at [[http://akizukidenshi.com/|Akizukidenshi 秋月電子]] there was an oscilloscope probe. It was the message I was waiting for, I need to upgrade from that cheap (yet pratical) DSO probe (one of the first versions). So I got myself a small factor one for less than 30 USD: a [[DL1540|Yokogawa DL1540]] functional! Made in 1992, it's closing on its thirties, with a vintage orange on black CRT screen. 150 MHz 4 channels, though channel 1 is dead. Leaves 3, and I have 2 probles (yeah I bought another one) only so no problem. Surprisingly the battery is dead so I'll change that and put a few pictures one of these days.<br/>

Guess what, after finally replacing the eInk that died on my [[eInk Weather station]], 1 week later the weather provider changed the API and removed the per hour forecast permission from the free plan! After Yahoo!, now it's WeatherBit who's playing tricks on me. So I spent a few hours cleaning up the code (shame on me it was and still is ugly) and re-implementing the weather source API from [[https://openweathermap.org|OpenWeatherMap]]! Big thanks to them. <br/>
Format was somehow similar so 3h of work while watching youtube were enough (a best practice to guarantee quality code and high efficiency).

Found an old DS Lite in the closet for my son to play with but of course the battery was empty, and impossible to find the charger or an USB adapter. But I remembered an old technique, and after checking continuity with the battery pins, I just stucked 2 wires in the plug and fed it with the USB 5v. Not a long term solution but it does the job for tonight.<br/>

My air conditionned is second hand like the house, and the remote bid us farewell. Luckily I have another Mitsubishi aircon for the which the remote works, but now I can use one out of 2 (I could turn both on but navigating between rooms with the remote is not fun). So should I buy again a remote (which failed first time because my aircon is an antique) or [[https://hackaday.io/project/165553-remoteduino|make one]]? I'd say the tipping point is 10USD: if a new working remote costs me less than that, I'll buy it. Let's see.
