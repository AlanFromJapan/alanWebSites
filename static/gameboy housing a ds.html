One day maybe ... <br />

I have that old GB brick now empty of its content (screen dead), I have that old Nintendo DS 1st version that was ugly from the start and has a broken screen connector ... Shall we reuse one for the other? <br />
Apparently doable, seing the piece of art this gentleman made:

<h1>Things to know</h1>
<h2>Screen</h2>
A DS can run with only one screen //but// you must trick it to think other screen is attached: put a resistor in lieu of the pins for the backlight (maybe in fact a protection to avoid short or whatever?)
* If you keep the bottom and dump the top screen: locate on the board the pins LED**C2** and LED**A2** which are the Cathode(-) and Anode(+) of the backlight of screen 2. On the v1 fat DS, it's to the top right next ot the Start button. Any resistor will go, I put a 1kOhm and works fine. Some people put a led+resistor, up to you.
* If you keep the top and dump the bottom screen: same, with LEDC1 and LEDA1, which is at the top-side around the lower part of the main board, slightly off-centered to the right.
