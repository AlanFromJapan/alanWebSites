          Observations on the Smokey circuit<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for fun, I built one of these during my lunch break the other day. I built it<br />
inside an Altoids can and used the circuit exactly as shown. Here are my<br />
observations after a couple of afternoons of playing with the circuit. <br />
<br />
As drawn, the circuit wants to oscillate badly and is very sensitive to component<br />
placement and the length of the battery leads. <strong>The supply pin (pin 6) should be<br />
bypassed to ground, as close to the chip as possible, using at least 0.1uf (TODO!)</strong>. This<br />
took care of the audible oscillation, but there were still some spurs that<br />
manifested themselves as spiky &quot;farting&quot; on otherwise clean tones. This might<br />
account for the complaints in various reviews that I've read that the Smokey is<br />
incapable of producing clean tones. <strong>Adding a 10 ohm resistor and .022 cap in<br />
series from pin 5 (output) to ground stabilized the amp and restored the clean<br />
tones. (TODO!)</strong> It did not have a negative effect on the distorted tones. You can try values<br />
from .01 to .1uF if you like. This R-C network should also be located close to<br />
the chip.<br />
<br />
The 47uF output coupling cap shown on the schematic will start rolling off bass<br />
around 400Hz. This may have been done on purpose to keep the small speaker<br />
from farting out. With a &quot;real&quot; guitar speaker connected, you'll get better results<br />
with a larger value cap. Try any value you like, up to 250uF for guitar. Even with<br />
the bigger cap, the little transistor radio speaker I was using didn't sound any<br />
worse than it did before. <strong>(the one on pin 7 I guess ?)</strong><br />
<br />
Incidentally, those little speakers are usually optimized for good treble response.<br />
I don't know of any tiny speakers designed for guitar use. (Are you reading this,<br />
Ted?)  You can use a variety of mechanical means of damping the cone to get<br />
rid of the &quot;buzzies&quot; and make the speaker sound a little better. This can be as<br />
simple as putting plastic sheet or cloth in front of the cone, or perhaps even a<br />
little thin cloth on the cone. If you can make the cone a little more dense, it won't<br />
respond to high frequencies as well. <br />
<br />
Some reverse polarity protection wouldn't hurt, especially if the amp might ever<br />
be used with an external power supply. A silicon rectifier diode between the<br />
supply and ground (cathode to supply, anode to ground) makes a crude but<br />
effective &quot;crowbar.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know if Zinky did this by design, by accident, or just to save the cost of a<br />
part, but one really unusual thing about the design as drawn is that pins 1 and 8<br />
are connected together directly instead of through a cap. Not only does this<br />
bypass the emitter of the differential input pair for higher gain, but it also affects<br />
the DC operating point of the internal transistors, which must have some effect<br />
on the tone. You could replace this shorting jumper with a 10K pot and see how<br />
the tone and gain of the circuit changes as you turn it up and down. <strong>(ok, I have a 10kOhm on version 2)</strong><br />
<br />
A very useful addition is a pot on the output to allow you to control the volume.<br />
A 25 ohm pot would work well whether you're using the unit to drive a speaker<br />
or the input of another amp. When driving an 8 ohm speaker, the minimum<br />
resistance seen by the amp will be 6 ohms, well within permissible limits. <br />
<br />
The little amp sounds fairly dark, which might be due to the guitar pickup being<br />
loaded by the 50K input impedance of the LM386. This might also explain the<br />
fairly low value of output coupling cap Zinky chose... He may have been trying<br />
to balance out the resulting muddiness. An input buffer seems a good idea here.<br />
A buffer would also allow you to insert gain and tone controls at the input to the<br />
386, with the gain of the buffer being chosen to make up for the insertion loss of<br />
the controls, plus maybe a little more gain for more distortion if you like. The<br />
possibilities of the basic concept are endless.<br />
<br />
I was surprised by the performance of this circuit, and I can see why so many<br />
Smokeys have been sold. The distortion is really dynamic and responds well to<br />
pick attack; it's also surprisingly smooth for a solid state overdrive sound. With<br />
some simple mods as outlined above, it cleans up very nicely when you back off<br />
your guitar volume or lighten up your pick attack. It drives a &quot;real&quot; guitar speaker<br />
(in my case, the 10&quot; alnico eminence in my Pro Jr.) to surprisingly loud levels;<br />
and it makes a great stompbox, if you add an output level control. There are<br />
many improvements and refinements that can be made, and I look forward to<br />
experimenting with this circuit in my spare time.<br />
<br />
I never gave much thought to the LM386 for guitar use--I always considered it a<br />
little &quot;junk&quot; chip for transistor radios and tape decks--but Zinky's simple, clever<br />
concept really has me intrigued. This is one of the best little solid-state practice<br />
amps I've ever used, even with its shortcomings.<br />

Jeeze Dave, I didn't know we were allowed to have lunch let alone do all that<br />
during lunch!<br />
damn bro'...your the &quot;man&quot;!<br />
Now let's stick a padded down high zed FET in front with a volume pot with<br />
tweed type tone stack between it and chip input, hook the output up to one of<br />
Ted's inexpensive 8&quot; signature speakers... all in a little 10&quot; x 12' x 6&quot; cab.<br />
We can have a Storknose amp.<br />

Lunch was an unknown concept when I was a full-time amp tech. But now I'm<br />
an engineer for Uncle Sam, and lunch is mandatory. Gotta love it!<br />
<br />
Luckily for me, my office is a workshop well-stocked with parts, tools and test<br />
equipment. Along with the stack of empty Altoids cans I've been accumulating<br />
on my desk, I had everything I needed to build my &quot;Smokey&quot; in no time flat.<br />
<br />
Now let's stick a padded down high zed FET in front with a volume pot<br />
with tweed type tone stack between it and chip input, hook the output up to<br />
one of Ted's inexpensive 8&quot; signature speakers... all in a little 10&quot; x 12' x<br />
6&quot; cab.<br />
<br />
Yep, that's basically what I had in mind as a next step... either a JFET buffer or<br />
an op-amp, and a simple tone and gain control at the input to the 386. That's a<br />
good suggestion about the 8&quot; Weber; I hadn't thought of that. I know Ted was<br />
making Champ speakers, but I haven't looked at his product line lately. <br />
<br />
We can have a Storknose amp.<br />
<br />
Would the volume knob be shaped like a bill? <br />
<br />
Speaking of the Pignose, I bought one a while back and discovered the only<br />
schematic available on the web was full of errors. So I carefully traced mine out<br />
and created a corrected schematic. I can CAD it and post it if there's any<br />
interest. <br />
<br />
Small amps have captured my interest lately because I live in an apartment and<br />
have been getting back into playing lately, after a long hiatus.<br />

Shoot! Now you have given me another project to work on. I didn't need that! <br />
<br />
<br />
Really, thanks for taking the time to post all that valuable information.<br />
<br />
By the way, where did you get the speaker and what were the specs of it?<br />

<br />
The speaker? Oh geez... It's just a little crap 8 ohm square thing, alnico magnet,<br />
about 3&quot; wide. I bought a dozen of them from Jameco to replace dead speakers<br />
in the intercom system in our TV studio. <br />
<br />
Like I said, the little amp sounds much better through a &quot;real&quot; guitar speaker.<br />
But as I wrote earlier, you can kludge the little junk transistor radio speakers to<br />
sound slightly better for guitar, at the expense of lowered output. The main thing<br />
is to cut the treble response.<br />

          The circuit mutates...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, here's where I'm at with the LM386 amp...<br />
<br />
Common-source JFET amp stage driving tweed-type tone and volume controls<br />
into inverting input of 386, series R-C from output to ground to stabilize amp as<br />
per previous post, 220uF output coupling cap, master volume control to<br />
speaker/line out. <br />
<br />
I am very, very pleased with the tone and response of this little monster. It has<br />
much more oomph than the original Smokey circuit, and is definitelty less prone<br />
to oscillate  I'll post a schematic when my experiments are done.<br />

HA ha ha.. thank you, I thought for sure I'd be the one to have to do it!<br />
Should be kinda tubey sounding with a little RC &quot;sizzle&quot; control circuit in there.<br />

there.<br />
<br />
It does sound and play surprisingly &quot;tubey&quot;... not much of the usual solid-state<br />
nastiness going on at all. But the discrete JFET amp is, by its very nature, rather<br />
low gain and high output impedance and is loaded down somewhat even by the<br />
simple volume-tone control arrangement I used. I had to use fairly low-value<br />
pots because the following impedance (the input to the LM386) is pretty low<br />
(50K). It actually sounds a bit more ballsy when the JFET drain is coupled (via<br />
.022uF) right to the 386 input. With that arrangement, it makes a good &quot;no<br />
controls&quot; circuit in the spirit of the original Smokey.<br />
<br />
For volume and tone controls, though, I'm starting to think that a better<br />
approach might be to use an opamp input stage or perhaps two JFET stages.<br />
More experiments to take place this afternoon...
