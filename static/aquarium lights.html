<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
I was a shameless sinner who made aquarium lights with a resistor to limit the current and a boost converter. I have no excuse. And when the powers of the aquarium decided that water spash would finish eating the copper of my connector, I understood the message from above (well, below in that case since the water is below the leds): make it right.<br/>
So I'll use a proper power source, with led strip (still) and PWM modulation (which means [[timers and 555|555]]). Basic circuit, but the best answer to a basic need.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
** 555 and PWM made simple**: honnestly I didn't find aywhere on the net any //simpler// PWM with 555 circuit. 2 resistor, 1 cap, 1 diode and you get a range from 1% to 99% duty PWM, this is the //simplest 555 PWM circuit// I could find. Just what you need in most cases. Other circuits have more parts without being that much more complex to be honnest. Let's use this one and see.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to set the simplest possible **astable 555 oscillator**. One other very similar circuit is [[http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator|here]], with an online calculator.<br/>
In a nutshell, the key ideas are (from above site):
* Increasing C will increase the cycle time (and hence, reduce the frequency).
* Increasing R1 will increase Time High (T1), but will leave Time Low (T0) unaffected.
* Increasing R2 will increase Time High (T1), increase Time Low (T0) and decrease the duty cycle (down to a minimum of 50%)
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* MOSFET x1: IRFZ44N power N-Channel mosfet => **sink** (what I had in my toolbox to be clear, thank you eBay)
* 555 x1: [[timers and 555|The 555]]
* Resistors for PWM: R1 = 100ohm, R2 = 100ohm
* Cap for the PWM: C1 = 0.1uF
* Diode: source diagram calls for a Schottky diode, but a regular simple diode works just fine and makes no difference as per my tests. So I go for the cheap one.
* Potentiometer (I used a 5k Ohm one but any other value should be ok maybe? try and tell me)
* A PPTC (resettable fuse) of 0.5 A, just in case, since we're putting water and electricity quite close. A fuse on the main would have been a nice touch too.
* 12v1a power supply I bought in HK years ago
* A strip of white leds I don't remember I bought but thanks SeeedStudio anyway
* other misc bling bling, caps for power stabilization, leds, screw connector, etc...
<h2>Settings</h2>
With a measured duty cycle of 50%, we're at about 5-7kHz (forgot exactly), and with a bit less than 2 meters of white led strips we have a comsumption of 0.47A at 12V (says my power supply). It's bright enough, and after a couple hours of continuous running, the "hottest" component was the 555 that went lukewarm. All the rest and especially the MOSFET staid at room temperature.

That's what I madeâ†‘<br/>
**Nota bene:**
* D1 doesn't need to be a Schottky, any cheap diode works. But it's necessary or you won't get less than 30% duty.
* R3 is necessary to stop the enormous ripples! without it you can get +30v-10v swing !! Just put it, something between 100-500ohm seems to do the trick (I used 510 ohm in my final design) -> Thanks to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_NeqlJgOs|Great Scott]] video for the tip! I noticed the ripple but didn't know how to fix.
<h2>Source code</h2>
None in this case, there's no mCU.

<span style="color:red;">Nota Bene: </span>if you follow [[http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator|this link]] you'll find a simpler version with only 2 resistor and 1 cap BUT the minimum duty cycle I can get without the Schotky diode is 30%-ish (100 ohm/100ohm/0.1uF). With a simple Schotky diode, you get a 1%-90% duty easily.
