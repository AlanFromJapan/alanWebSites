I always wanted to backup my old IR remotes. I have old (25+ years) air conditionner units at home, and 2 remotes died on me already. Before I end up without any replacement second hand, let's do a simple project to address that. And also the cheap remotes of some devices (like my TV monitor for instance).

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
* With the python app: scan your old IR remotes, save the codes in a small sqlite DB
* Generate the arduino code automatically to clone your remote
* Make your own remote clone
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
<h2>Points of frustration</h2>
* It's using an arduino (or just an ATmega) because it uses the IRremote arduino library. It's a complete waste of power to use such a big chip for that. One day maybe I'll rewrite it with an ATtiny...
