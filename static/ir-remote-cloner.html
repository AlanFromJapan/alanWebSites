I always wanted to backup my old IR remotes. I have old (25+ years) air conditionner units at home, and 2 remotes died on me already. Before I end up without any replacement second hand, let's do a simple project to address that. And also the cheap remotes of some devices (like my TV monitor for instance).

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
* With the python app: scan your old IR remotes, save the codes in a small sqlite DB
* Generate the arduino code automatically to clone your remote
* Make your own remote clone
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Parts should be quite interchangeable. Aim at 940nm for the IR Led for remote usual range.
* Use a transistor (NPN - sink side) to drive the IR LED for max out the power. Choose the resistors as per your LED spec.

<h2>Points of frustration</h2>
* It's using an arduino (or just an ATmega) because it uses the IRremote arduino library. It's a complete waste of power to use such a big chip for that. One day maybe I'll rewrite it with an ATtiny...
* The IR Receiver model I use (PL-IRM2121-A538 that I bought a decade or more ago) marked "10T6327" is a greedy m*********er and needs 50mA to work (100ohm resistor R1) though the datasheet says "max 2.5 mA". If you put R1 = 1k then it will receive but can't decode and the program interprets it as garbage. So my protoboard has some artistic pigibacking (but it's their charm, isn't it?)
