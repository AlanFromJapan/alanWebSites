<h1>How-to</h1>
<h2>Eagle/Kicad</h2>

1) In **Eagle**, use CAM job and export the **(t|b)Cream** layer and the **Board shape** auto-layer. You get a .GRB file (Paste_Top.GRB if you choose the right Function but name is irrelevant).<br/>
<br/>
2)Then in **Gerbv** load that .GRB file only and choose File > Export > SVG ...<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Laser cut</h2>
<h3>Stencil edit</h3>
You can edit the stencil by first "ungroupping" it, and then it's just a bunch of shapes you can edit/remove.
<h3>Laser Settings</h3>
I use my small laser cutter (5W laser). Just import the SVG file and use these settings:
* 20mm/s
* 95% power
* Constant intensity
* 3 passes

So why these settings and 3 passes instead of 1 slower? Because these settings give super clean cut with no burn mark at all. 1 pass is not enough to cut, 2 might be enough, 3 is. And at this speed, small board with 1-2 SMD MCU or other chip should take about 1min or less so ... who cares.<br/>
<h2>The stencil</h2>
That's the interesting part: MtG Magic the Gathering cards! Bought 15 kg(!) of them for a song a couple years ago. Finally found a use for these tens of copies of extra common cards. And result is perfect for one offs. I imagine you can reuse the stencil a couple of times, but considering the time and cost, it doesn't bug me to make one each time I would do a batch.
