I want to make a small weather & reminder to throw the trash for my home entrance. Depending on the day in Japan you're supposed to throw one or another type of garbage and I //always// miss the "non-burnable" one, because it's the "second and fourth Thursday of the month"... So this toy will show me the weather, a few other interresting info and if it's the day for what type of trash.<br/>

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
<img src="/files/einkweather-blockdiagram.PNG" />
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* Raspi Zero W but any clone will do. You will want internet.
* in my case a [[https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT|2.13 inches eInk display]] from eBay (250x128 pixels)
* Perfboard, buttons, led, etc...
<h2>Installation</h2>
<u>For the eInk:</u><br/>
All is here: [[https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT]]. Now I think of it I think the bcm2835 extra stuff is not needed if you use Python and GPIO... give a try and tell me.
<pre><code class="bash">
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo pip install wiringpi spidev
wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.52.tar.gz
tar zxvf bcm2835-1.xx.tar.gz
cd bcm2835-1.xx
./configure
make
sudo make check
sudo make install
sudo apt-get install python-smbus  python-serial python-rpi.gpio
#updated to use Pillow instead of PIL
sudo python -m pip install pillow
</code></pre>

<u>For the weather:</u><br/>
<div style="text-decoration: line-through;">
Python [[https://pypi.org/project/weather-api/|Weather API]] based on Yahoo!:
<pre><code class="bash">
sudo pip install weather-api
</code></pre>
</div>

<div style="text-decoration: line-through; text-decoration-style: double;">
The above stopped working Jan 2019, so I moved to [[http://www.WeatherBit.io|WeatherBit.io]]. 
You register, they have a free plan and comprehensive and simple Json API. I added a class to parse it and extract what I need. You'll need to put your private key in the //config.py// file though.
</div>
<br/>
The above stopped working Jan 2020, when WeatherBit.io removed the hourly forecast from the free plan. So you know the story, I wrote another provider that uses [[https://openweathermap.org/|OpenWeatherMap]] and we're back in business. Really happy I took time to rewrite things last time, it went like a breeze.

<h2>Source code</h2>
On the git : [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/Python/EinkWeatherStation]]<br/>
<br/>

Pretty simple, you have 2 buttons [next and validate], the code revolves around 3 main panels that you can go through by clicking [next]:
* Main panel: shows the weather of now and tells you what it will look like in a few hours. It also shows today's date and the latest update time
* Shutdown panel: if you click [validate] the raspi will shutdown and show you a "the end" screen
* Others panel: misc stuffs, for now only shows the current IP 

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td> <!-- The text -->
<ol>
* Soldered the eInk screen to some perfboard I hadso I don't have to stack it on the Raspi Zero W and I can access the other pins (I'll need some buttons and LED)
* Add buttons and LED!
</ol>

** Pinout (eInk ⇒ Raspi pins)**:
* 3.3v ⇒ pin 01
* RST ⇒ pin 11
* BUSY ⇒ pin  18
* DIN ⇒ pin 19
* DC ⇒ pin 22
* CLK ⇒ pin 23
* CS ⇒ pin 24
* GND ⇒ pin 39
<br/>
** Pinout (buttons ⇒ Raspi pins)**:
* button 1 ⇒ pin 32
* button 2 ⇒ pin 36
* button GND ⇒ pin 34
<br/>
** Pinout (LED ⇒ Raspi pins)**:
* LED+ ⇒ pin 29
* LED- ⇒ pin 30
