<h1 id="toc0"><a name="Purpose"></a> Purpose </h1>
Need a web server for self hosting, use a [[Raspi|Raspberry Pi 2]] of course (seeing I expect 200-300 page views a day we're safe). I need a DMZ in my internal network so the old router sleeping in the closet found a new life. I also had those beefy AC/DC modules in my lucky bag in Akihabara years ago, make the 110v a steady 10.5V with a decent amount of amps (measured 4 when short cutting I think). Throw in a couple of step down "buck" converters (no 7805) from eBay to have a decent efficiency and get my 5v for the Raspi as 3.3v for the router. Interresting fact this SoB of router does not work with 3.3v but is fed about 3.5-3.6v otherwise it doesn't start or keep rebooting. Not the fault of the power module, I tested with my beefy DC supply and with a precise 3.3v it keep on rebooting. The original power plug was measured 3.47V (though labelled 3.3v), so, what the hell, it works, maybe not for a century but I'll manage.<br />
The whole thing is stuffed inside a SNES body that was the empty shell of my <a class="wiki_link" href="Around%20a%20SNES.html">Arcade cabinet made with a SNES</a>. I had to make fake joypad port, just wood with a few holes and painted/varnished the same as the SNES original grey, ... if you don't pay attention it makes acceptable illusion.<br />

<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
<ul>
* [[Raspi|Raspberry Pi 2]] for the web server: could be any of the Raspi familly in fact if you have a small site, just runs a website in python and maybe nginx
* AC/DC converter from 110V to something like 5~12V. Mine gives 10.5V at 4A when shorted, more than enough
* An old Buffalo router that you bring back from the closet of the dead with [[http://www.dd-wrt.com|DD-WRT]] a fantastic alternate firmware. Luckily my old router was in the list, installation was a bit tricky but it worked.
* Buck converters (no 7805) to lower the AC/DC converter output DC voltage to the 5V needed by the Raspi and 3.5V needed by the router (it says 3.3V but that doesn't work, it needs a tad bit more to boot).
* A old Super Famicon to host your project with nobility and nostalgy
* I sacrificed a cartridge and stuck a fan inside to suck out the hot air in summer, but it ended up making so much vibrations that I turned it off (not documented)
</ul>

Now comes the fun. My goals are to:
<ul><li>Serve static content: html, css, images... I don't care/desire php modules or else, I'm fine editing my site with emacs (yes, I do)</li><li>A little dynamic though: if I could do some page combination on the fly like ASP.Net master page or maybe have a few tags dynamcally parsed, that would be cool but I <em>could</em> live without it.</li></ul>

<span style="color: #ff0000;font-size: 140%;">✗</span> Which is what I did first, it handled bravely a few attacks until some a$$hole found a breach and killed it with a few commands. Yeah, BaseHTTPServer is not the most robust implementation. <br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:limegreen;">✔</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Flask</span> is the answer. and that's the way to go!<br/>
I used the **Flask** to build a custom single editor multithreaded webservice. I can edit pages on the site live, that works quite fine. It's a work in progress, but if you're interrested do check on github, there's the **full site**: [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanWebSites]] <br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;font-size: 140%;">✗</span> Not Apache (robust but cabalistic config), but maybe an easier/lighter Nginx? Would have worked but I wanted some flexibility.

<h1>Installation</h1>
I put it here for memory, since when I make update I work on other servers now (all the content is on Github so why not?).<br/>
<br/>
The site executes under **Python 2.7+**:<code>
* sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
* sudo easy_install pip
* sudo pip install Flask
* sudo pip install futures
</code>
You need //flask// as the main engine, and you need //futures// for multithreading thread-pool for blinking leds. The above commands get you //easy_install// to get //pip// to get the before mentionned packages.<br/>
<br/>
Now to get the site source : <code>git clone https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanWebSites.git</code> and go get a small coffee.<br/>
Once downloaded, edit the <code>electrogeek.ini</code> file and run by <code>python electrogeek_flask.py</code> or use the start script.<br/>
<br/>
Notes regarding the Leds: adding the leds support came with a few tricks (and thanks to [[https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/40105/access-gpio-pins-without-root-no-access-to-dev-mem-try-running-as-root|this person]] for sharing):
* Need to run a Jessie debian so go for a <code>sudo rpi-update</code> and the usual apt-get update/upgrade
* Does not run as root so the web server user must be in the gpio group <code>sudo adduser webuser gpio</code>
* And in case you still get a no access to /dev/mem, check the permissions and do <code>sudo chown root.gpio /dev/gpiomem ; sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem</code> 

<h1>Network</h1>
<h2>Topology</h2>
I won't go into micro details here because it will change between your house and me, and it gets a little too private. I'm no network expert, so forgive if some details I keep before me.<br/>
<img src="/files/website_architecture.png" /><br/>
//Dashed lines are wifi, plain are wired, red is DMZ (as setup in the main router) and blue is regular intranet//
<h2>Security</h2>
On the main router:
* "DMZ router" is the DMZ target for the main router: all incoming extrnal traffic is redirected to that DMZ router
* All external incoming traffic to the DMZ router management port is //rejected// (important)
* NATing (port 80 external - port XYZ internal) can happen on that router (not in my case though)
On the DMZ router:
* NATing of individual ports to the webserver: port 80 for http, 443 for ssh (not HTTPs, ssh so I can admin from outside and fool my company proxy), 8089 for dev server
* Only incoming traffic is allowed on these 3 ports, no outgoing traffic allowed (only RESPONSE traffic)
* All traffic from Dev server to Internal NW is rejected (except on the 3 ports as explained above)
