Bought myself a [[https://www.htpow.net/atomstack-p7-m30-laser-engraver| HTPow P7 M30]] laser burner and I'm doing the setup on **Ubuntu 22.04** so let me share my experience here, in case it helps you.

<h1>Setup</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* My laser burner [[https://www.htpow.net/atomstack-p7-m30-laser-engraver]]
* A laptop on Ubuntu 22.04

<h2>Assembly</h2>
My manual was in Japanese but clear enough so just [[https://www.htpow.net/index.php?route=download/download/download&download_id=20|RTFM]].<br/>
**HOWEVER there was 1 problem**: the Y axis (not the one with the laser, the other one) was **too stiff**, and had some simili positive stops, make the laser stuck it if reached those points (belt wasn't strong enough and anyway the bouncing would have been a catastrophe). The reason is a one line I missed so please don't : at step 1 make sure to **loosen the hex bolt** on the X (the one with the laser caddy). Which direction? No idea, but after some tweaking and lots of cursing it ended sliding smoothly enough.<br/>

<h2>Computer setup - USB connection</h2>
First use a recent Linux, I tried on an old Mint19 (which was OLD in 2023) which owed me a few hours spend on upgrading and setting up my laptop to a Ubuntu 22.04 (the LTS of the time - March 2023). Reason is that recommended beginner (=me) software has a dependency on a quite recent glibc, not matched in old Mint 19 and installing mutiple glibc is heavily non-recommended on the net.<br/>
Then install [[https://lightburnsoftware.com/|LightBurn]] which works on Linux as a 30 days demo. Hopefully enough for me to level up and move to some free software like [[https://www.linuxcnc.org/|LinuxCNC]] but let's not skip steps.<br/>
Then you plug the USB, launch LightBurn aaaaaaaand ... it doesn't work. It doesn't find you LaserBurner. Yes it's normal, for some time the USB setup on Ubuntu and its consorts need a few steps. I had the [[linux mint|issue on Mint with my ATmel AVRISP mkII programmer]]. So let's make it work.

<h3>Get the USB to work on Ubuntu 22.04</h3>
See the **EXCELLENT tutorial** of that gentleman : [[https://diode-laser-wiki.com/documentation/setting-up-the-software/#USB_Driver]], basically I'm just doing a slight variant. Credits go to him! <br/>
<br/>
Reason is that it emulates a serial port on USB to communicate GBRL commands, a CH340 as per lsusb. And now if you want to use it WITHOUT being root, you need to add a few steps to make it a "familly and kids approved" device. But there's even a catch ... see below.<br/>
First add your user to the //dialout// group :
<pre>
sudo adduser **my-user** dialout
</pre>
Now logout and login again to make it effective.<br/>
<br/>
Then //lsusb// and find the vendor ID and product ID of your device.
<pre>
> lsusb
...
Bus 001 Device 008: ID **1a86:7523** QinHeng Electronics CH340 serial converter
...
</pre>
<br/>
**EXTRA FUN:** the vendor:product ID pair is in fact maybe ALREADY registered in your system as a Braille reader! You need to un-register it first!<br/>
Check //if you have the britty file//: edit the **/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/85-britty.rules** file, find the line with your vendor ID (1A86), find your product (7523) and hashtag that line or remove it.<br/>
<br/>
Now let's give access to non-root users: edit an existing file in **/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/** (NOT the files in /etc/udev/rules.d/!!!), add to the **70-uaccess.rules** and add the below text in the  ‚Äú3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, 3D scanners, etc.‚Äù section (should be at the bottom of the file):
<pre>
#QinHeng Electronics CH340 serial converter for HTPOW P7 M30 Laser burner (Serial over USB for GRBL)
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7523", GROUP="dialout", MODE="0666"
</pre>
Then to be safe remove brltty if you don't need it (or if above didn't work):
<pre>
sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove brltty
</pre>
Now restart the udev service (or to be extra safe if it doesn't work, Windows style reboot):
<pre>
sudo service udev restart
</pre>

It should work now...

<h3>Moment of truth</h3>
Run LightBurn, it won't find your burner anyway so make a generic GRBL, and when you're in power cycle the laser (important!) and try the Move window => Home : the head should reach its home position! Check the Console window which shows the connection status, sometimes a few stop/start are necessary to get connected but it works at the end (for me).<br/>
<br/>
Now Device menu and import the settings from the machine, it will help correct whater you misinput at the GRBL device creation. 
<h1>Softwares</h1>
<h2>LightBurn (non-free)</h2>
Seems the best for beginners, 30 days trial, but after that 8000kJPY/year ...
* Official site [[https://lightburnsoftware.com/]]
* Check [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3RDzOrlCTM|this official video]] for startup, in 10 minutes you get the laser burning something. Then check other videos for details.
* Excellent first project video for a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPyIuLlcuIE|WiFi QR code]] üëâ Make a QR code with text <code>WIFI:S:<SSID>;T:<WPA|WEP|>;P:<password>;;</code> as [[https://qifi.org/|QiFi.org]] says.

<h2>LinuxCNC</h2>
Even the userspace version (non-RT kernel) version didn't want to install, my Ubuntu 22.04 is too recent, needs old libraries so... maybe worth a try as a version on a USB stick? Makes it nomade, doesn't polute your "normal" PC nor forces you to run on their frozen environment and RT kernel, but would require some config to make it pleasant to use maybe (file exchange, mails etc.) Or just do your designs in Inkscape on your main PC and use this as a "burning station" only?
