I usually work with Atmega328 chip, the same as Arduino. I make my programs in the ArduinoIDE and compile it. Then I upload the .hex binary file to the card via a pololu ISP on the chip that is sitting in the arduino board (skip the bootloarder) or on the board it resides itself (but then I solder a 6pin ISP and that bores me to death). Most often I keep on putting the chip, moving the chip somewhere, put it back, program, take it out, put on the test board, ... over and over ... not really optimized.<br />
What I wanted was a board that :<br />
<ul><li>Allows me to program in place having already a ATmega--8 series compliant 6pins ISP</li><li>Allows me to access the chip pin for soldering to surrounding (a bit like a breadboard)</li><li>Allows me to not solder or solder easily those glue components (crystal, crystal caps, ...)</li><li>Has space around the chip to solder the other components</li><li>Has power rails easily accessible</li><li>Has no need for a serial or USB connection</li></ul>Well, if you agree with most of these points, Rapide328 might be a PCB for you.<br />
In addition to that, it has a feature that is its strength and weakness : it's a 5x5cm board, very small! Good for small projects, less good for medium/large projects, you'll need a daughter board. Or you'll want to see the Rapide328 sister's board, the <a class="wiki_link" href="Veloce328.html">Veloce328</a> who is 5x10cm.<br />
<br />
And in case you wonder, yes, &quot;rapide&quot; means &quot;rapid&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;, and it's <em>French</em> like me :P It's a board made to help you make your projects more quickly.<br />
I'm not following the trend of <em>-uino</em>-suffixing stuffs. <br />

You can do your own (Eagle code is right under) or mail me (on the left side of the page) I'd be delighted to provide it to you for 200-300 JPY %20 shipping depending where you live and how many you order. Please note that it's just the pcb naked I would send you, without any component. <br />

The real card (first batch, card v1.0)<br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc5"><a name="History"></a> History </h1>
<strong>20111207:</strong> first batch of 10 pcb ordered to Seeedstudio. v1.0 was a good exercice in Eagle and took maybe 7 hours to be made (in multiple sessions of 1-2h). Now I could make the same in 3h I guess, that's the learning curve.
