<img src="/files/GP2Y1010AU0F_mini.jpg" align="right" />I found these 5USD dust sensor (counter is a big word in fact) on eBay and tried it. Since I do woodworking as a second hobby, having a sensor to make sure I'm now brownlungig myself into pneumonia. So one stone two birds.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
That cheap module has a IR led and sensor that is calibrated to return a voltage that is function of the volume of dust in the air. I put a small led bar in front since I'm not interrested by the value, an indication of the air quality is enough for me.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* The usage of that small sensor
The rest is pretty much ballpark, no additional challenge.
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* GP2Y1010AU0F Compact Optical Dust Sensor Smoke Particle Sensor
* [[http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gP-01704/|DMC16117A]] 16x1 LCD with strange behavior
* An Arduino because I have too much of them
<h2>GP2Y1010AU0F Dust Sensor how to use</h2>
**Pinout**<br/>
On mine, the connector wire colors are (looking at the plug on the sensor, wires bottom, left to right):
* <span style="color:lightgrey;">White</span>: V-LED
* <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span>: LED-GND => GND
* <span style="color:green;">Green</span>: LED 
* <span style="color:yellow;">Yellow</span>: S-GND 
* <span style="color:black;">Black</span>: V0
* <span style="color:red;">Red</span>: VCC

//Datasheet vs. homemade approximation//<br/>
I decided to use 2 linear approximations, using 5V:
* The blue one Y = 6 X + 0.6
* The orange one Y = 0.5 X + 3.25
And use one or the other depending where you are:

<pre><code class="cpp">
/* Takes the voltage (in V) read and return the dust density based on the graph provided in the Datasheet
 */
float voltage2DustDensity (float pVoltage) {
  if (pVoltage <= 0.6) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (pVoltage <= 3.4) {
    /*
     linear regression calulated from key values at (v=0.6 dust=0) and (v=3 dust=0.4)
     x = (y  - b) / a
    */
    return (pVoltage - 0.6)/6.0;  
  }

  /*
   voltage > 3.4 same with [0.5;3.5] and [0.8;3.65]
   x = (y  - b) / a
   */
  return (pVoltage - 3.25)/0.5;  
}
</code></pre>


<h2>Schematics</h2>
Follow the schematic from the datasheet for the Dust sensor. The board is a [[WordClock]] board because it was proper in term of size. The Led bar is linked via a bunch of 1k ohm resistors to pins 27 to 15 (arduino A4 to 9), and the Dust sensor pin connected to A5 for reading and 8 (arduino) for driving the LED.
<h2>Source code</h2>
It's an arduino script because I was too lazy to write it properly in C in Atmel Studio. Code is here [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/DustCounter|on GitHub]].
