I moved this year to "Linux only" (Mint) and I have not yet had the occasion to setup the necessary tools to do AVR development on the PC. This is the occasion to start and document, so that I can do it the same way on all the PCs at home...

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
I will go 2-flavor: the Arduino suite (for arduinos !) and the AVR toolchain (for all the other MCUs). 
<h1>Arduino toolchain</h1>
<h2>Foreword</h2>
I'm using LInux Mint 19 (based on Ubunto 18.04 LTS). **DO NOT USE THE PACKAGES THAT COME WITH MINT 19**, they are totally outdated. It's a shame but that's how it is.<br/>
We need to take a detour for doing the install the right way.
<h2>Install</h2>
That one is easy: go to the [[https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software|arduino website]] and download the latest .tar.xz file. You can then //tar -zxf// it or just double click and put the insides somewhere. No need to run the installer unless you want to setup the icons. There, install completed!<br/>
**Nota bene:** regarding the //where// to install, I did in /usr/local/apps (which I created). Where to install software in Linux is an eternal debate, so I picked here, but it doesn't matter it will work anywhere.

<h2>Install</h2>
I followed [[https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-get-started-with-Eclipse-and-AVR/|this doc]] with minor editions/customizations. We'll use the [[http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/The_AVR_Eclipse_Plugin|AVR Eclipse plugin]].
* Get Eclipse, download the **[[https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/|Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers]]**, not the regular (Java).
* Get some packages while it downloads <code>sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude</code>
* Install Eclipse in your /opt folder, //tar zxvf// the file
* In Eclipse, Help > Install new software ... > add this source "http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/updatesite/" and install
* Manual for a first build is [[http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/user%20manual/gettingstarted/gs_newproj.html|here]]
* (note that on Linux Mint 19 I didn't have to do the operations I described [[linux mint|here]] to enable my mkII programmer, it worked out of the box)
<h2>Setup</h2>
Well it just works, that's great. As [[https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-get-started-with-Eclipse-and-AVR/|this doc]] explains:
* New "C Project"
* Pick "AVR Cross Target Application"
* Choose the mCU and F_CPU
* Once project created, right-click > Properties 
* AVR > AVRDude pick your programmer
* C/C++ Build > Settings: Set the optimization and make sure to generate the HEX for Flash in your Release config (and check AVRDude for update on the fly)

I tried 2 projects, one hello world and the [[USB without Arduino|USB keyboard]] sample: just worked like a breeze. No issue or none worth even mentionning. Linux rules! (^_^)b
