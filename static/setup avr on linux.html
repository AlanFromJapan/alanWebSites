I moved this year to "Linux only" (Mint) and I have not yet had the occasion to setup the necessary tools to do AVR development on the PC. This is the occasion to start and document, so that I can do it the same way on all the PCs at home...

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
I will go 2-flavor: the Arduino suite (for arduinos !) and the AVR toolchain (for all the other MCUs). 
<h1>Arduino toolchain</h1>
<h2>Foreword</h2>
I'm using LInux Mint 19 (based on Ubunto 18.04 LTS). **DO NOT USE THE PACKAGES THAT COME WITH MINT 19**, they are totally outdated. It's a shame but that's how it is.<br/>
We need to take a detour for doing the install the right way.
<h2>Install</h2>
That one is easy: go to the [[https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software|arduino website]] and download the latest .tar.xz file. You can then //tar -zxf// it or just double click and put the insides somewhere. No need to run the installer unless you want to setup the icons. There, install completed!<br/>
**Nota bene:** regarding the //where// to install, I did in /usr/local/apps (which I created). Where to install software in Linux is an eternal debate, so I picked here, but it doesn't matter it will work anywhere.
