Need to press Play/Pause quickly on your cellphone while listening to music and charging at the same time.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
A small USB **Consumer device** (not a keyboard!) you'd plug on your cellphone and allow to 1) charge it and 2) do basic media function such as Play/Pause, Next, Prev, and Vol+ and Vol- if I feel fancy. The reason is that while I like to work with my music, going next forces me to touch button to see the screen, then touch another tiny tiny button to press Next or Pause. I like to surf through my music to find something that match the mood or the task at hand, so I do that often and that's a (minor) pain. And an excellent pretext to tinker :)
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* As simple implementation of a media keyboard, very very similar to the [[Usb Volume Control]] I made (and works just fine)

<h2>Helpful sources</h2>
* Apparently one can be OTG slave AND provide power if FIRST it connects the power wires only AND THEN connects the data wires? [[https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cable-to-Use-OTG-and-Simultaneously-Charge-the/|link]]
* Another gentleman with a similar (?) design said he can charge and be OTG [[https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1822653|link]]
* ... and it continues and lead to [[https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3/general/hw-mod-usb-otg-charging-galaxy-s3-t1953061/post33293981#post33293981|here]] after passing through a site that makes me feel good about my website design skills. I include the image schematic here, in case.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
* [[Usb Volume Control]] is nearly identical, remove the spinning encoder for volume and add 2 buttons. Done.
