The goal of this page is to make a logical, simple workflow and entry point on how to start from an idea to a game running on your physical Gameboy.<br/>

<h1>Materials</h1>
<h2>Make images</h2>
Make sprites or extract them from existing games with [[GbReaper]].
<h2>Make sounds</h2>
For making simple sounds, use that : [[https://github.com/Zal0/GBSoundDemo|GBSoundDemo]].
<h1>Coding</h1>
<h2>Coding the game</h2>
My "guide" [[Gameboy guts and programming]] but in a nutshell:
* Code in ASM if you want to make a serious, complex game
* Code in C if you're ok with a small, casual game and ready to have average performance
<br/>
I code in C so my TL;DR is:
* Install the latest [[http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/|sdcc]]
* Install [[https://github.com/andreasjhkarlsson/gbdk-n|GBDK-n]]
* Edit the GBDK-n scripts to use latest sdcc
* You're good to go, start coding!
<h2>Testing the game</h2>
* The best is [[http://bgb.bircd.org/|BGB]] and runs on windows or Linux under wine
<h1>Making a physical cartridge</h1>
<h2>Making the PCB</h2>
The [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge/tree/32kB-variant|32 kB PCB]] is what you want, and more confusing details on the [[gameboy homebrew cartridge]] page.
<h2>Writing the ROM</h2>
* [[Gameboy homebrew cartridge writer]] client software in Python3 to upload your code to the EEPROM
<h2>Assemble</h2>
* Solder the EEPROM on the PCB, then you're done
