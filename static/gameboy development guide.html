The goal of this page is to make a logical, simple workflow and entry point on how to start from an idea to a game running on your physical Gameboy.<br/>

<h1>I - Materials</h1>
<h2>Make images</h2>
Make sprites or extract them from existing games with [[GbReaper]].
<h2>Make sounds</h2>
For making simple sounds, use that : [[https://github.com/Zal0/GBSoundDemo|GBSoundDemo]].
<h1>II - Coding</h1>
<h2>Coding the game</h2>
My "guide" [[Gameboy guts and programming]] but in a nutshell:
* Code in ASM if you want to make a serious, complex game
* Code in C if you're ok with a small, casual game and ready to have average performance
<br/>
I code in C so my TL;DR is:
* Install the latest [[http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/|sdcc]] (readme below)
* Clone [[https://github.com/andreasjhkarlsson/gbdk-n|GBDK-n]]
* Edit the GBDK-n's bin/ scripts by changing the path to sdcc to latest sdcc 
* Build GBDK-n (just run make at the root, if you didn't edit but created new scripts edit the Makefile to force usage of latest sdcc)
* VS code or Eclipse work to code in C
* You're good to go, start coding!
<h3>Installing latest SDCC</h3>
Well, last time I did a few years ago it was easy as far as I remember: download latest version, unbzip and done. I rna into a problem though: the prebuilt latest 4.2 was built with more recent libc version than my ubuntu 20.4. <br/>
EASY FIX: pick version 4.0 or 4.1 (4.1 worked out of the box).<br/>
HARDER FIX: just build SDCC from the source on my PC.
* Get the source from [[http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/|sdcc]] (in the sdcc/ folder)
* tar jxf thesource.tar.bz2
* [[http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.pdf|RTFM]]
* ./configure
* A few packages I was missing : sudo apt install bison flex libboost-graph-dev texinfo
* ./configure (this time should work)
* make (go grab a coffee)
* sudo make install
<h2>Testing the game</h2>
* The best is [[http://bgb.bircd.org/|BGB]] and runs on windows or Linux under wine
* visualboyadvance runs also on Linux but has a worse reputation than bgb so keep it as a second option in case
<h1>III - Making a physical cartridge</h1>
<h2>Making the PCB</h2>
The [[https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge/tree/32kB-variant|32 kB PCB]] is what you want, and more confusing details on the [[gameboy homebrew cartridge]] page.
<h2>Writing the ROM</h2>
* [[Gameboy homebrew cartridge writer]] client software in Python3 to upload your code to the EEPROM
* Use the [[TL866II]] EEPROM writer
<h2>Assemble</h2>
* Solder the EEPROM on the PCB, then you're done
