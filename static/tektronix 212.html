Bought mine in a Hard-off in Yamanshi in december 2024 for 2,300 JPY. "Doesn't turn on when powered" said the label.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Initial state</h2>
* Indeed doesn't turn on
* Inside is overall clean except 4 spots having lots of black gunk
* Batteries are missing
* Top board unconnected, moderatly bent pins

First conclusions: batteries leaked, were removed with minimal tenderness. Luckily didn't do too much visible damages. 
<h1>Attempt 1</h1>
//Remove the gunk with IPA, unbend pins and plug back top board.//<br/>
Operation worked fine, but still doesn't turn on. Need more close inspection, maybe dead components or it just can't run without batteries even on AC?<br/>
Battery should be 2 x **6v 1.4Ah battery pack** (2 because needs 2 of them).
