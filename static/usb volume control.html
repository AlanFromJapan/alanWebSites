<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
Important subtlety I didn't get at first: we implement a "<u>Consumer device</u>" **not** a "Keyboard"! Hence my surprise that the codes for the Volume control on Keyboard and the ones implemented were different (see the [[http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage#HID_Usage|HID doc]] chapter 10 vs. chapter 15).<br/>
Good thing is there are lots of nice functions possible to implement too, like a "Next" button that I'm much more interrested to bind to the click of the rotary encoder to that rather than mute.<br/> 

<h1>Schematics</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
<ul>
* Rotary encoder, in my case cheapo eBay guys which are **not** EC11 as I lost hours to understand (thank you eBay vendor). Same principle though: 2 pins A & B pulled up, if you turn left they go low in order A then B, if you turn right it's B then A. Once you get that, you're in business. But again **not** fancy encoders with state keeping like EC11 of Alps.
* A board for USB, like the great [[RapideUSB]] board by your host (^_^)
* All the usual V-USB dings and dents : 2x 3.6v Zener diodes, 2x 68 ohm resistors, 1x 1.5kOhm, 12MHz crystal, caps, ...
* [[ATtiny2313]] or [[ATmega8a]] for instance, but program is small so no real problem here. You'll just need a few pins to read the encoder and the button
* Some leds for the bling bling
</ul>
