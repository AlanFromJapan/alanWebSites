<h1>Documentation</h1>
<h2>Power cable</h2>
<img src="/files/usbcables_for_clock.png" /><br/>
You want an USB **mini** cable, like the old generation of consoles, etc... not the USB //micro// that you use for your cellphone. Usually you can find it in your closet or at the dollar store.

<h2>Power supply</h2>
**Requirements: ** the clock uses regulated 5v at about **250mA** continuously, so you need to plug it to a power supply that delivers **exactly 5V** and **at minimum 250 mA**. That should be ok with any recent cell phone charger, but do check the label please!<br/>
Examples:
* 5v - 250mA: bare minimum, avoid if possible 😐
* **5v - 500mA: recommended! 😊 ** 
* 5v - 1A: that works too! 😊
* 5.2v -500mA: that might work, but avoid it please.😐
* 5v - 100mA: don't use! Risk of fire! 😠
<br/>
If you use a cell phone charger, there will be no problem. If you make your own charger from parts, make sure to create a **regulated 5v output**. There is no regulation on the board itself (it's there but not populated) because it is assumed you will use a regulated power supply. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just use an old USB charger please.
<h2>Setting the time</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="/files/alan_numitron_clock_front_view_buttons.png" /> 
</td><td>
There are 2 buttons at the back of the clock: A and B. A = Select and B = Increase.<br/>
<ol>
* Press A and you enter the time set mode: it will highlight the **hours** (led turns on). Press B button for +1. You can stay press on B and it will increase slowly.
* Then press again A, it will highlight the **minutes**. Same as before, do +1 by clicking B or stay clicked.
* Press again A and the leds turn off, you're done.
</ol>
<br/>
<span style="font-size:small">Note: the A/B button clock detection is not perfect so be patient and try again. Sometime it double clicks, sometimes it takes time to get it. Apologies for that, it is a known limitation of the code as of today (2017-04-10).</span>
</td></tr></table>
<h2>Changing the battery</h2>
Estimated life is 2 years or more, but it depends on the battery itself.
<ol>
* Unplug from power
* (optional) Unscrew the 4 legs of the top board
* Remove old battery
* Put new battery (CR2032 of the dollar shop)
* (optional) Screw back the 4 legs of the top board
* Plug power
* Set time again (see above)
* Finished.
</ol>
