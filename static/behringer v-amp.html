Some random stuffs about my **Behringer V-Amp**!

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
A guitar virtual amplifier, very nice, small and cheap. 
<h1>Power supply</h1>
<h2>Why</h2>
In second hand auctions, I managed to score a V-amp 2 and later a V-amp 3 but in the end I have only one power supply. So I hoped to make one for cheap and sell the "improved" V-Amp 2 therefore, maybe with an USB cord instead! Might not be that easy though... 
<h2>Details</h2>
Unusual thing for this puppy is the power supply:
* 4 pins + casing type of connector (old mouse/keyboard style for the boomers)
* 11V **AC** and 20V **AC** : not DC!

After probing : 
* Connector case is ground, 
* Left/Right pair of pins are a AC (1 AC and 1 GND)

<br/>
Opening the beast, the investigation continues:
* One AC signal (the 20v) after regulation by diodes goes to 2 15v regulators : 7815 to make 15v and 7915 to make -15v
* One other AC signal (the 11v ?) after regulation by diodes and caps stays as is
* Part of the above signal goes to an old faithful 7805 to become 5v (with a big fat heat sink)

I bought this below venerable transformer, sirca 1978 edition (Showa 53 as we say here in Japan). It has the voltages I need with sufficient amps. Details are listed below. <br/>
