**README:** this is the same board as the [[Alan numitron clock]] but with changes on the tubes board to host some [[nixie tubes and alike|Numitron IV6 tubes]], and some additional parts to generate the high and low voltage needed.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
A clock using the low voltages [[nixie tubes and alike|Numitron IV6 tubes]]. They need 2 voltages, ~1v and ~20v to shine with all their blue power. So need to generate those voltages too: the high one via those inexpensive voltage boost converter of eBay, the low one with a voltage divider.<br/>
I'll also use the occasion to use those addressable WS2812B Leds that are everywhere on internet: much less hardware hassle, it goes to the mCU. And since it was busy doing nothing, that shouldn't be a problem.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Usage of Numitron IV6
* Sink-side driving the tubes 20v with a combo of ULN2803 (NPN darlinton array) and 74xx595 (SIPO)
* Play with thoses WS2812B leds
* My first <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> board
