More than a manual, a small list of reminders for me. If you find it useful, good for you.

<h1>One liners & frequent commands</h1>
<h2>Cancel your git add</h2>
Don't delete anything, just "un-add" everything.
<pre>
git reset
</pre>
<h2>Rollback all your local changes and go back to latest commit</h2>
You messed up, nothing works... happens. My reason #1 to use a VCS, so you can mess up thing and always go back to latest known status in one command. This WILL delete files created afterward also.
<pre>
git reset --hard
git clean -f -d
</pre>
<h1>HOWTOs</h1>
<h2>Migrate a folder with its history to another repository</h2>
I had to do that because I put everything (C#, python, microcontroller, eagle,...) files in one repository which obviously became too big and kind a messy. So I decided to move out some chuncks of it outside to a dedicated smaller repo (ie: eagle files in May2020). This is how I did it.<br/>
<br/>
**Foreword**: I based this on [[https://medium.com/@ayushya/move-directory-from-one-repository-to-another-preserving-git-history-d210fa049d4b|that tutorial]] that I followed but it wasn't clear enough to me so let me re-explain it my way, but credits go to the author of the original one.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Theory</h3>
Basically you add to the //target-repo// a reference to the //source-repo//, merge the histories, remove the reference to the //source-repo// and done. But there's a few steps to that.<br/>
You need to remove everything you don't want from //source-repo// before copying to //target-repo//. Obvious, because otherwise the whole hisotry of everything would be duplicated, a waste of space and not your goal (you want 1 folder to move).<br/>

<pre>
#Say you want to move folder source-repo/FOLDER_TO_KEEP to target-repo/NEW_FOLDER with its whole history and content.

#create a dummy work folder
mkdir temp-repo
cd temp-repo

#checkout source-repo there
git clone [source-repo-url]

#remove immediately the link to the origin to avoid messing up the original one
cd source-repo
git remote rm origin

#there, now even if you mess-up your changes won't be pushed to github

#now a command you don't often type: it will delete everything in your repo EXCEPT the FOLDER_TO_KEEP
# and !!surprise!!, it will move the content of FOLDER_TO_KEEP to the root of the repo
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter [FOLDER_TO_KEEP] -- --all

#pruning & cleaning violently
git reset --hard
git gc --aggressive 
git prune
git clean -fd

#now your repo is clean as a whistle of any record of information except the FOLDER_TO_KEEP part BUT now the files are at the root of the repo

[OPTIONAL]

#maybe you want the files in a subfolder of your repo, not at the root? so let's do it
mkdir NEW_FOLDER
mv -R * NEW_FOLDER/

#make sure everything is committed
git add -A .
git commit

[/OPTIONAL]

#now go to your target-repo
cd ../target-repo

#plug a reference to your modified copy of the source-repo. Not the real source-repo, the one you just cleaned up in temp-repo/ folder
#"dummy-name" is just to give a label to the reference. anything is fine, you'll delete it in 2 minutes. I will go with "dummy-name"
git remote add dummy-name [path-to-temp-repo-folder]

#now the magical mariage of the 2 repos history
git pull dummy-name master --allow-unrelated-histories

#remove that dummy reference
git remote rm dummy-name

#and now the local target-repo has gained all the files and history of source-repo concerning FOLDER_TO_KEEP, time to push to github
git push 

#go grab your preferred drink, you earned it
