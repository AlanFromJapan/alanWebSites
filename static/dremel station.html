I have not a Dremel per se, but a cheap ass Hongkongese (which I physically bought in HK) hand drill/engraver/cutter. It's cheap and working just fine for what I need now. But I yearn for a drill press or to a lesser degree a drum sander or even a table saw.<br />
That project is for some time in my mind, 'cause let's face it, without a drill press I can't drill in straight line through wood (shame). I happen to find that video via <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hackaday.com/2014/12/29/diy-super-accessory-for-your-dremel/" rel="nofollow">my daily reading of Hackaday</a> and the gentleman made a very nice stuff! Not sure I'll go that far but that's really a motivation to make my own. He doesn't have a drill press but that should be really doable...<br />
