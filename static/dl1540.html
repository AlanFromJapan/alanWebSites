This page is dedicated to my **Yokogawa DL1540**, a piece of history. Built in 1991, bought that baby "second"-hand on Yahoo auctions in Jan 2020, soon 30 years after it was turned on for the first time and guess what? It still works (well ... mostly)!<br/>
Age took its toll, especially on the fire retardant ABS plastic that is now entirely yellow, but there's also a few things to fix or improve, so let me keep it here for memory. Who knows, in 10 years maybe someone will be happy to read it?

<h1>Things to fix</h1>
<h2>Battery</h2>
Bought the parts at Akizuki, a battery holder and a Li-ion battery, just need to open the beast. Procedure is extensively described [[https://www.suwatsu.com/hobby/report/report_0002.htm|here]].<br/>
One thing that bothers me is that the self-test says that the battery is ok... though 1) it looses the time between poweroff 2) logic says that a 30 y.o Li-Ion bettery is for all purpose dead. I'll change it anyway, although the procedure to open the oscillo looks tedious.
<h2>Channel 1</h2>
Plug a probe, leave it as is, no difference: it stills shows zero volt. Annoying 'cause I can't do the funny Lissajous curves, but otherwise can be ignored if I stick to "digital" electronic.
