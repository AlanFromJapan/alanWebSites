I bought a **OSC5A2B02** that is a cheap 10MHz oven controlled frequency generator. What can we do with that?

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
An oven controlled frequency generator that spits a very clean 10MHz. 5v in, takes 600mA at startup to warm and 200mA after that to maintain. Praised vastly on the net for the excellent cost/performance when a precise 10MHz is needed.
