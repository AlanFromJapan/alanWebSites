One VERY important thing about programming atmega64a babies : you can do it via SPI but don't use the ports MISO and MOSI ! Sounds crazy ? To me too. But read the doc !<br />

<br />
WHAAAAAT !?? Not using MISO/MOSI but 2 other pins ! WTF couldn't you say that before I send the cards to produce in China ? Ok it's a matter of 1500 JPY but still. I spent hours (literally) searching why my cards didn't work. <br />

... and wait, there's more !<br />

</style><pre class="text">2.3.15 PEN
This is a programming enable pin for the SPI Serial Programming mode. By holding this pin low
during a Power-on Reset, the device will enter the SPI Serial Programming mode. PEN is internally
pulled high. The pullup is shown in Figure 10-1 on page 52 and its value is given in Section
28.2 “DC Characteristics” on page 327. PEN has no function during normal operation.</pre>

<br />
WHAAAAAT !?? I have ALSO to pull that pin <strong>/PEN</strong> low when I program ??!! And cherry on the cake, that pin is dedicated to that purpose, can't reuse it ... great.<br />
<strong>Edit:</strong> In fact it seems you don't <em>have</em> to bring /PEN low, it works fine if not doing it with my pololu programmer. That's one annoyance less.<br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc2"><a name="FUSES - READ ME"></a> FUSES - READ ME </h1>
And the fun continues : if you don't remove the <strong>Atmega103 compatibility</strong> mode <strong>M103C fuse</strong> you can have ... strange behavior. Very strange. In my case, I could call a function but the code never got OUT and the method was stuck in a loop ... wicked right ? Just unset the fuse, maybe set the clock to 8MHz oscillator at the occasion. And you're done.<br />
