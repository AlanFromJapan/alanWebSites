Well, guys with a mostly linux ecosystem, tired of calling their servers by IPs, a good Japanese main router that unfortunately lacks that function and who searches for a good excuse to play with Linux. And the additional "performance improvement".

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
Normally, you LAN/Wifi router does the DHCP and DNS. Mine is an idiot, it does DHCP but not DNS. And no, I can't flash it with DD-WRT (my other DMZ and else routers are under DD-WRT). And no, I don't want to change if for a newer one because it works perfectly otherwise and I don't want to redo all the settings on a new router. Once it will die of old age yes, but not if I can avoid.<br/>
So,there's going to have a small [[Raspi|Raspberry Pi]] connected to the router and it will be the DNS cache and service for the whole home NW. Basically, it will:
* Have fixed well known DNS for the fixed IP in the home network
* Use Google or whatever other DNS service for the rest of the DNS
* Do some caching for the tiny performance improvement (afterall it's here so let's use it)
Solution is according internet to use **dnsmasq**, which is (as per my readings) better in simplicity than **bind** and does all what one need for a home network. So let's give it a try.
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* dnsmasq implementation and config
* [[Raspi]] Zero and an USB ethernet
* Making my life more comfortable
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
* Raspberry Pi Zero: the best balance between performance (low requirements) and power consumption (low too) so will be gentle with my electricity bill
* USB to Ethernet module: [[http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-2-0-to-RJ45-LAN-Ethernet-Network-Adapter-For-Apple-Mac-MacBook-Air-Laptop-PC-/172365741860?epid=1985584390&hash=item2821cc7f24:g:pbsAAOSwNRdX9gkq|cheapo eBay]] one needed because Raspi Zero has no onboard ethernet and I have no Raspi 1 free at hand, and any other Rapi (2 or 3) would be an immense overkill
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<h2>Setup</h2>
**USB Ethernet**<br/>
The one I bought (like 3 USD delivered) is a Kontron DM9601 based one and contrary to what [[http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Ethernet_adapters|Internet might say]], it works flawlessly so far (now the kernel module was fixed). Just plug it and boum, //eth0// appears in //ifconfig// list.<br/>
After that you can turn off the wifi (if Raspi ZeroW) with //sudo ifconfig wlan0 down// (temp fix, TODO add permanent fix here).<br/>
<br/>
**USB OTG on the cheap**<br/>
You don't want to pay 77 JPY for a cable delivered? (seriously?) Or you just need to put some USB stuff on your Zero //now//? [[http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-OTG-Hack-Add-a-Fullsize-Connecto/|Solder an USB female connector to the solderpads on the bottom]], though only 4 wires you get a regular USB port (not OTG). Did that on mine, D+/D- are a bit close so don't make a solder bridge but that's average solder level job.<br/>

* GND on PP6
* D+ on PP22 (green)
* D- on PP23 (white)

//Left cable is for Power (you can see the data wires unplugged) and bottom is the USB de-OTG-ized//<br/>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
* **sudo apt-get install dnsutils dnsmasq //htop emacs-nox//**<br/>italic ones are non-mandatory
* **sudo service dnsmasq stop **
* **sudo emacs /etc/dnsmasq.conf**
* Just change one line to tell it to read sub-config files in /etc/dnsmasq.d/<br/>**conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d**
* Make your custom config file in /etc/dnsmasq.d (in my case **local.dnsmasq**)
* Edit your **local.dnsmasq** as below:

# ==> don't use the above it doesn't work for forcing some fixed IPs. Use the below **addn-hosts**

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/hosts, uncomment the

#no-hosts
# or if you want it to read another file, as well as /etc/hosts, use

addn-hosts=/etc/dnsmasq.hosts

# automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file.
expand-hosts

<ul>
* Make a file **/etc/dnsmasq.hosts** where you will put your custom DNS entries (or you can put it in the //hosts// file of the server, up to you). Format is:<br/>192.168.0.123 fileserver<br/>192.168.0.11 router
* Restart the service **sudo service dnsmasq restart **
* Test with **dig fileserver.at.home** and you should see in the trace 192.168.0.123
* Change the settings of your other PC or router to use your new DNS server and you're good to go. 
* Now go to your router and tell it to use your DNS server. Usually it's by editing the list of DNS server (primary & secondary) and/or doing that by domain like with mine where I registered that for whatever "at.home" request, ask my new DNS server. 
</ul>

<h2>Setup the DNS server on your Linux</h2>
Linux mint 19.2:
* in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> add at the top <code>nameserver 192.168.0.2</code> (the IP of the new DNS server)
* refresh <code>sudo service networking restart</code>
Done.

//The final result: the Raspi Zero on the left hotglued on a piece of wood for stress release on the wires, the USB Ethernet adapter on the right (the white thingy with a red light glowing inside) and the main router in the back. The Raspi is powered by the router which has a USB port for external HDD which I didnn't use ... 'till now.//
