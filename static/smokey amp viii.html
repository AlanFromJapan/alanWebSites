<h1 id="toc0"><a name="Version 3 Info"></a> Version 3 Info </h1>
 Based around a LM386 amplifier (in my case a JRC 386), the idea was to make it for a guitarist colleague, and also for myself maybe.<br />
<br />
<em> ... continued from <a class="wiki_link" href="Smokey%20amp%20vII.html">Smokey amp vII</a> </em><br />
<strong>20110601:</strong> <img src="files/heart.gif" alt="heart.gif" title="heart.gif" />made a version 3, using the excellent schema of M. Dino Segovis on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hackaweek.com/hacks/?p=131" rel="nofollow">hackaweek</a>. All soldered on the chip, so less EMF sensitivity, less size and ... well I just wanted to do it. Speaker is better stuff and in the end this amp turns out to be quite good with a very clear sound!<br />
<strong>20150111:</strong> My wife needed a small amplified speaker for her studies: 4 hours later she gets it in a nice box. Same circuit, working just fine.<br />

① This circuit is and will remain sensitive to static, so if you're up high close ot a radio emitter or if you have your cellephone close you might get blips! or static or even the radio. Careful shielding should do the trick but I never cared enough to try.<br />
② Do <em>not</em> skip the RC branch composed of the 0.047uF &amp; 10ohm resistor: it will work without but it sounds <em>so much better</em> with. Why, I never cared to search for but it's a fact (tested and approved).</span><br />

<em>Version 3, the best that sounds very clear. The trick : everything is soldered on the chip and glued for safety!</em><br />
<em>A very big thank you to M. Dino Segovis for <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hackaweek.com/hacks/?p=131" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this schema on Hackaweek!</a> </em><br />
<em>The big red one is a very dense foam bought at TokyuHands, very easy and fun to work with. Bought a brick and just cut through with a solid cutter and pliers. The other version bread-board like has same issues as others (you can hear the radio) but it's just for prototyping.</em><br />
