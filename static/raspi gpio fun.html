The idea is to add a few inputs/outputs on a Raspberry Pi puppy.

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Idea</h2>
* I want a proper shutdown button for my webserver (Raspi 2)
* I want to add some bling bling like blinking a led at each file served
* Pilot so display to show message on a led board?
<h2>Points of interrest</h2>
* Any pin is caoable of GPIO. Not maybe 100% pure hardware (in terms of timing) but jsut any pin will be ok
* RPi.GPIO lib can't do hardware PWM, all the PWM are software but at least you can have it on any pin
