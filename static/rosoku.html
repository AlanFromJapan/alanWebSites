Ok, so Rosoku (that should be written &quot;rousoku&quot; or even better 蝋燭　ろうそく) means candle in japanese. I stumbled upon that project today (2012/02/08) and found it quite interresting, like the kind of thing you can do on a big evening or a sunday afternoon, to change your mind of other long run projects. Also looks perfect to finally play with thoses <a class="wiki_link" href="Attiny13.html">Attiny13</a> I bought the other day, I have at least one spare <a class="wiki_link" href="Arduino%20and%20a%20thermometer.html">LM35 for the temperature</a>, a few RGB leds, some button battery ... hum... <br />
It is also my first project using AVR Studio 5, which is a great tool but <a class="wiki_link" href="AVRStudioFlasher.html">missing a little something...</a> <br />
<br />

I unfortunately notice that my dear <a class="wiki_link" href="Attiny13.html">Attiny13</a> has only 2 PWM pin, not 3 ! How can I drive my RGB led with that since I don't want to use an external IC? Just PWM it yourself. <br />
