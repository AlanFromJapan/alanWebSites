All is said, I bought a new member of my mini-pc at home, this time it's an [[http://www.orangepi.org/orangepi2/|Orange Pi 2]]: kinda similar to a Raspberry Pi2, but with more muscle, wifi onboard and (unfortunately) poorer software. Well OS is a Linux, I have no plans to send it to Mars yet, so I guess that I'll get what I can on internet and learn how to setup the rest.<br/>

<h1>Hardware</h1>
<h2>Power</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Vendor says 1.5-2A power is needed. I tested with 1A, mine turns the leds on, but nothing happens on the HDMI... hard to believe this guy needs 10W to run... Waiting for the 2A USB charger to arrive to confirm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wifi</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To enable wifi connection from command line run: **sudo nmcli -a d wifi connect** and enter your wifi credentials</li>
</ul>
<h1>Operating system</h1>
<h2>Install</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not necessarily what I will do but interresting read on [[http://www.orangepi.org/orangepibbsen/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=342|this forum]]</li>
  <li>I'm trying the Debian server (headless), just under 1GB uncompressed. I'll post my impressions here.</li>
</ul>
