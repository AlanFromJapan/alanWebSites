All is said, I bought a new member of my mini-pc at home, this time it's an [[http://www.orangepi.org/orangepi2/|Orange Pi 2]]: kinda similar to a Raspberry Pi2, but with more muscle, wifi onboard and (unfortunately) poorer software. Well OS is a Linux, I have no plans to send it to Mars yet, so I guess that I'll get what I can on internet and learn how to setup the rest.<br/>

<h1>Hardware</h1>
<h2>Power</h2>
<ul>
* Vendor says 1.5-2A power is needed. I tested with 1A, mine turns the leds on, but nothing happens on the HDMI... hard to believe this guy needs 10W to run... Waiting for the 2A USB charger to arrive to confirm.
* Couple of days later I get my 2A power supply, and in fact it was the HDMI that was not working so maybe it did work with a 1A, but I'm too lazy to double check so sorry. 2A plug it is.
</ul>
<h2>Wifi</h2>
<ul>
* The Wifi module I have is a **Realtek RTL8189ETV** as per the specs, though it's writen //Createk CK-W-R189// ?
* Driver is noted //rtl8189es// in //dmesg//
* I read that to enable wifi connection from command line run: **sudo nmcli -a d wifi connect** and enter your wifi credentials, but to no avail
</ul>
If found an old cheap Wifi dongle in a drawer, chip is a **Realtek rtl8188cus** that is apparently supported by the Raspi, so maybe I can make it work here too...
* Some guy struggling here [[http://blog.donity.com/k1/2011/02/22/gw-usvalue-ez-%E3%82%92-ubuntu-%E3%81%A7/]]
* Some guy who made a script BUT do not run it as is, you must edit it (I tried, it forced me to do a reinstall): [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=6256&start=375]]
<pre>
# lsusb
to list the usb
# modprobe -a 8188eu
to load module [[http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/tutoriel/tout_savoir_sur_les_modules_linux]]

<h1>Operating system</h1>
<h2>Install</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not necessarily what I will do but interresting read on [[http://www.orangepi.org/orangepibbsen/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=342|this forum]]</li>
  <li>I'm trying the Debian server (headless), just under 1GB uncompressed. I'll post my impressions here.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Software</h1>
Now to the fun part. 
* Started with the OPI2 "Debian server" version: plugged on TV and ... nothing. Ethernet leds stay on, nothing on the TV (though some mode change happens, you see the TV react and change display mode) no text nothing. Waited, waited, retried. Nix. 
* Then tried alternate distributions [[http://www.orangepi.org/orangepibbsen/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=342|here]]: still no ethernet, no wifi, no HDMI **but I had Serial interface** (3.3v by the way):
* - Debian jessie minimal: no ethernet, no wifi, no HDMI 
* - Arch linux minimal: no ethernet, no wifi, no HDMI 
* Then [[http://www.orangepi.org/downloadresources/|Raspbian]] and I got the **Ethernet working**! HDMI I didn't test (don't care), and still no wifi though but we're making progress...

* Apparently there's another geek in Japan with a OPi2 [[http://blog.osakana.net/]]

<h1>Rebooted - March 2016</h1>
Ok, I decided to start over:
* OS: I put an armbian [[http://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-2/]] ... oh found [[http://www.cnx-software.com/2016/03/16/orange-pi-one-board-quick-start-guide-with-armbian-debian-based-linux-distribution/|this tutorial]] (afterward of course)
* It **MUST** run with a beefy USB power supply or the boot process will just fail and stop in the middle
* Upgrade all //apt-get update; apt-get upgrade//
* To enable Wifi with a small dongle, need to install nw tools: //apt-get install network-manager //
Setting up the network with //nmcli// ([[https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Networking_Guide/sec-Connecting_to_a_Network_Using_nmcli.html|doc1]], [[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Networking_Guide/sec-Using_the_NetworkManager_Command_Line_Tool_nmcli.html|doc2]]):
* Existing NW setup:  nmcli con show
* Status of NW connections: nmcli dev status
* Wifi NW around: nmcli dev wifi list
* Specific connection details: nmcli connection show id //connection-id//
* Wifi on/off : nmcli radio wifi on
* Wifi connect: nmcli c up id //connection-id//
* Change server name ([[http://www.howtogeek.com/167195/how-to-change-your-raspberry-pi-or-other-linux-devices-hostname/|doc]]): edit /etc/hosts, run /etc/init.d/hostname.sh, and finally reboot
My favorite //.profile// ([[http://bashrcgenerator.com/|profile generator]]):
<pre>alias m='emacs'
alias emcas='emacs'
alias cls='clear'
alias als='ls -alF'
#alias temp='/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp'
alias killoldssh='pkill -o -u $USER sshd'
alias cd..='cd ..'
alias temp='cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp'
</pre>

<h1>Re-Rebooted April 2020</h1>
Ok forget everything above, install [[https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-2/|Armbian]], ubuntu or debian flavor, connect via screen/keyboard or via Serial (3.3v at 115200bps). Login "root" password "1234".<br/>
* No wifi out of the box but plug a cheapo Wifi dongle and it just works
* [[https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/|Getting started]] - Connect to wifi: nmtui-connect //your-wifi//
