You can find on Aliexpress these "Resistor calculators" or "mini calculators" for less than 1,000 JPY or less than 500 JPY even, but using it and not making it, where's the fun in that? And the MCU they use aren't the flavor I'm used to so tinkering would take exponential time because the learning curve and yet another rabbit hole...<br/>
So let's make my own üòÅ!

<h1>Presentation</h1>
<h2>Principle</h2>
* Make it usable (something I //will// use in the future)
* Keep it simple (minimum power MCU, minimum viable functionnalities, etc.)
* Make the PCB at home
* Reuse parts I have at home (a very nice old school 4 digits 16segments)
* Scavended Li-ion battery 
<h2>Thought process</h2>
<h3>MCU</h3>
Computation power required is minimal (no external crystal, internal oscillator fine), Electric power too, no need for special interface (I2C, TWI, ...). The differenciating factor will be ... the **number of pins**.
* 10 digits + a reset button? = 11 buttons => 3x4 buttons matrix => 7 pins for the keyboard
* ISP for programming => 0 hopefully? (reuse the buttons matrix ones)
* LCD is 4 digits and 16 segments so "123k" or "456M" is possible but still needs 10 pins (7 data + 2 address + 1 control) it seems => 10 pins for the screen
<br/>
‚àë = 17 pins needed. Add 2 for power, 1 for /Reset ... looking minimum at a **20 pins package**.
<h3>Keys matrix</h3>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
As much as possible done with parts laying around, so I won't be hitting the peak matching need/capabilities:
* Buttons with clear cap (had to buy those on Aliexpress)
* PCB made at home
* MCU : ATmel Tiny ???????
* Display [[http://www.nomad.ee/micros/dl2416/|DL2416 vintage]] I got in a lucky bag at Akiba many years ago
